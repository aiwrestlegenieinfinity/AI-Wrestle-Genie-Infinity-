    ATTACK! Pro Wrestling: Founding and Early Years    

     2. Founding and Early Years    

      Historical Context: The UK Wrestling Scene in 2011    
The   British wrestling scene in 2011   was undergoing a transition. The once-thriving   World of Sport-era grappling culture   had declined throughout the late 20th century, giving way to a landscape dominated by WWE and limited local promotions. However, beneath the mainstream radar, a   new wave of independent wrestling   was beginning to take shape, driven by the rise of   high-impact, hybrid wrestling styles   blending British technical prowess, American storytelling, and Japanese strong style.  

Key influences on this shift included:  
‚úÖ   The Rise of PROGRESS Wrestling (2012)   ‚Äì A year after ATTACK! was founded, PROGRESS Wrestling emerged, ushering in a new era of   modern British wrestling  . While PROGRESS focused on a more intense,   punk-rock hybrid of wrestling and storytelling  , ATTACK! would carve out its own niche‚Äîone rooted in   creative, comedic, and innovative storytelling   while still showcasing high-level wrestling.  
‚úÖ   NXT‚Äôs Global Expansion Looming   ‚Äì WWE had not yet launched   NXT UK  , but as talent pools deepened and independent promotions flourished, WWE‚Äôs eventual   signing of UK talent   would shape the industry significantly in years to come.

-   Jim Lee   ‚Äì Another co-founder whose behind-the-scenes contributions helped structure the promotion.  
-   Eddie Dennis   ‚Äì One of ATTACK!‚Äôs defining figures, blending   technical skill with a commanding presence  , later moving on to NXT UK.  
-   Chris Brookes & Kid Lykos   ‚Äì As part of   CCK (Calamari Catch Kings)  , these two revolutionized ATTACK!‚Äôs   tag team division  , bringing a mix of aerial, technical, and hard-hitting styles.  
-   Nixon Newell (Tegan Nox)   ‚Äì A cornerstone of the women's division, showcasing athleticism and resilience that would later earn her a spot in WWE.

3Ô∏è‚É£   COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)    
- Like many independent promotions,   ATTACK! was hit hard by the pandemic  , forcing event cancellations and operational shutdowns.  
- Without the   financial backing of a larger company  , the promotion had to find ways to   stay relevant without live shows  .  

      Conclusion: ATTACK!‚Äôs Enduring Legacy    
Despite facing   numerous obstacles  , ATTACK!   cemented itself as one of the most influential UK independent promotions   of the 2010s. Its blend of   top-tier in-ring performances, comedic brilliance, and innovative booking   made it a   fan-favorite   and a   launchpad for future stars  .
