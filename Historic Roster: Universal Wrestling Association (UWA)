The Universal Wrestling Association (UWA), also known as the Universal Wrestling Alliance, was a Mexican professional wrestling promotion founded in 1975 by Francisco Flores, Benjamín Mora, and wrestler Ray Mendoza. Established as an alternative to the dominant Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), the UWA quickly became a leading promotion in Mexico and an innovator in the sport. Its primary venue, El Toreo de Cuatro Caminos in Naucalpan, became iconic for its vibrant shows, regularly drawing large crowds.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the UWA helped pioneer a blend of traditional Mexican wrestling (lucha libre) with North American wrestling styles, which attracted international wrestlers and established UWA as a unique brand. It became known for its alliances with international promotions, particularly Japan's New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), allowing for talent exchanges that raised the profile of its stars globally.

The UWA roster boasted several legendary luchadores, including El Canek, Dos Caras, Mil Máscaras, and Perro Aguayo. UWA was also a launchpad for many promising young wrestlers who later became prominent in the industry. The promotion’s World Heavyweight Championship and other titles, such as the UWA World Light Heavyweight Championship and the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship, gained prestige, sometimes being defended in the United States and Japan, increasing UWA's international profile.

However, the 1990s saw UWA face significant challenges. Shifts in the wrestling industry, combined with internal financial struggles and competition from new promotions like AAA, eroded its dominance. By 1995, these issues became insurmountable, and UWA ceased operations. Despite its closure, UWA's influence endures, especially in the evolution of lucha libre and the international exposure it brought to Mexican wrestlers. Its innovative approach, willingness to collaborate with international promotions, and cultivation of top talent left a lasting legacy on both Mexican and global professional wrestling.
