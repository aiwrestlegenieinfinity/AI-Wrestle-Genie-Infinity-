1996 marked a pivotal year for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as it surged in popularity with the debut of the New World Order (nWo). Storylines were rooted in realism, blending kayfabe and shoot-style drama to revolutionize wrestling. WCW had a deep roster, including legends (Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan), workhorses (Dean Malenko, Chris Benoit), and rising stars (Rey Mysterio Jr., Eddie Guerrero). Managers were being phased out, but Jimmy Hart remained as a loud and loyal advocate for his talent.

-   Moral and Philosophical Debates  :
