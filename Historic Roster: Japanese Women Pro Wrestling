Japan Women’s Pro Wrestling (JWP) was founded in 1986 as an alternative to the dominant All Japan Women’s Pro Wrestling (AJW). It aimed to offer a different style of joshi wrestling, characterized by faster paced and technically oriented matches, giving more focus to athleticism and in ring storytelling. JWP's roster included a mix of younger talent and veterans who wanted a fresh start, which allowed for a dynamic blend of experience and innovative wrestling styles.

Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, JWP built a reputation for its distinct approach, emphasizing pure wrestling skills, which helped cultivate a dedicated fanbase. Key figures like Devil Masami, Mayumi Ozaki, and Cutie Suzuki became some of its standout stars, adding to the promotion's appeal. JWP frequently engaged in inter promotional events, including crossovers with AJW, which enhanced its visibility but also highlighted the competitive nature of the joshi scene at the time.

In 1992, internal disagreements about management direction and vision led to a major split. This resulted in the creation of two separate entities: JWP Project, which continued the original name's legacy with a focus on pure wrestling, and the emerging LLPW (Ladies Legend Pro Wrestling), which aimed to emphasize entertainment elements alongside wrestling. The split reshaped the joshi wrestling landscape, setting the stage for a more diversified and competitive scene in the 1990s.
