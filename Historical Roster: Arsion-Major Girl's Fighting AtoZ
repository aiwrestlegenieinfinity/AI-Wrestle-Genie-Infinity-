Arsion was a Japanese women's professional wrestling promotion founded by Aja Kong and headed by Rossy Ogawa . It launched in February 1998 and aimed to bring a new style to joshi wrestling, blending traditional Japanese techniques with elements of lucha libre and submission based wrestling. Arsion’s in ring approach, known as “Hyper Visual Fighting,” emphasized a more realistic, athletic style, contrasting with the flashier and more dramatic styles popular in other promotions at the time.

During its early years, Arsion built a reputation for its innovative match styles and focus on technical prowess. Wrestlers like Ayako Hamada, Mariko Yoshida, and Michiko Ohmukai became key figures, with Yoshida’s submission based style becoming a defining feature of the promotion. The company’s matches often featured intricate holds, counters, and a blend of styles that appealed to hardcore wrestling fans looking for a purer form of athletic competition.

Despite the strong start and a dedicated fanbase, internal issues and financial difficulties led to a decline by the early 2000s. Aja Kong's departure in 2001 marked a significant shift, and the promotion struggled to maintain its early momentum. Arsion was eventually rebranded as A to Z in 2003 , but it ceased operations in 2004 , marking the end of a unique chapter in the history of Japanese women’s wrestling.
