Prompt Library and Resources

This resource is used with the AI-Wrestle Genie Infinity Custom GPT, which can be found on Chat-GPT. You will find separate files with Prompts that open new paths to explore. Below is a layman's breakdown of what AI-WGI can do, with real-world examples for each feature:

---

      1. Historical Wrestling Simulation  
  What It Does:    
Imagine stepping into a time machine and reliving iconic wrestling moments precisely as they happened. AI-WGI ensures every detail—wrestlers, moves, titles—is accurate to the chosen year and promotion.  

  Example Use Case:    
i. First Copy and Paste in the Prompt: Match Simulations file as shown in the text

ii. Follow up with the Prompt inserting the historically accurate algorithms and match conditions yhou want to see
Example: Use maximum compute, focus on depth and precision, incorporate contextual relevance, prioritize creative and analytical balance, expand with layered reasoning, ensure multidimensional perspectives, integrate detailed explanations with examples, adapt tone and style to the audience, provide actionable insights or conclusions, highlight key takeaways upfront, and ensure clarity and logical flow: "Create historically accurate algorithms for all figures involved in a match between Hulk Hogan circa WWF 1984 vs Ric Flair circa 1987 booked in WWF circa 1985"   

Match Elements Explored:
1.   Historical Algorithm Setup for All Figures Involved: Wrestler personas, signature moves, wrestling styles, tendencies; managers' influence on match dynamics and psychology; referees' officiating quirks and alignment tendencies; bookers' vision and storytelling alignment; agents' expertise in pacing, improvisation, and finishes; era-specific promotion dynamics, crowd behavior, and cultural references.  
2.   Randomized Match Details: Opponent, referee, venue, stipulations, card placement, storyline context, championship stakes, managers/valets, entrance themes, ring announcer, audience demographics, weather, special appearances, technical presentation, cultural references, and fan interactions.  
3.   Pre-Match Creative Elements: Agent instructions defining pacing, storytelling beats, signature spots, and improvisational strategies; promotional materials, video packages, interviews, and live promos to establish feud motivations.  
4.   Match Context Setup: Historical dynamics of the wrestlers and promotion, card placement, storyline integration, match type, venue, and alignment with era-specific details.  
5.   Match Execution: Ring psychology aligned with roles, randomized negative elements (e.g., botches, sandbagging, no-selling), dynamic adjustments, crowd psychology, structured phases (opening, heat, hope spots, come back, finish), improvisation, and a match environment reflecting the era and setting.  
6.   Post-Match Perspectives: Insights from bookers, agents, wrestlers, locker room sentiment, fan reactions (casual and hardcore), commentary analysis, production crew feedback, and sponsor evaluations.  
7.   Dirtsheet Match Review: Insider critique on quality, pacing, storytelling, crowd engagement, and execution, with a star rating based on industry norms.
   
Post-match pathways include Vince McMahon's strategic use of the rivalry to enhance WWF's expansion and fan engagement and Pat Patterson's creative insights, such as introducing hitmen to prolong the feud or booking a gimmick match for future encounters. Commentary from Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura contrasts their personas, building intrigue for rematches. Flair's performance earns respect backstage, while Hogan's limited moveset sparks creative discussions. Fans are divided, with casual viewers embracing Hogan's win and hardcore fans debating Flair's superior technique. Commentary, production, and marketing teams identify the bout as a promotional triumph, suggesting iconic taglines and replay material. Follow-up pathways include high-stakes rematches like a steel cage or no-DQ match to settle the rivalry, Flair forming alliances with other heels to challenge Hogan's dominance, and cross-promotional intrigue with Flair targeting WWF faces to fuel inter-promotional wars. Long-term booking options include Hogan's potential heel turn if Flair's mind games drive him to desperation or a redemption arc for Flair, evolving him into a conflicted anti-hero to test audience dynamics and ensure the feud remains fresh and impactful.
