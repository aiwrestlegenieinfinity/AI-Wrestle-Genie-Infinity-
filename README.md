Prompt Library and Resources

This resource is used with the AI-Wrestle Genie Infinity Custom GPT, which can be found on Chat-GPT. You will find separate files with Prompts that open new paths to explore. Below is a layman's breakdown of what AI-WGI can do, with real-world examples for each feature:

---

     1. Historical Wrestling Simulation 
  What It Does:    
Imagine stepping into a time machine and reliving iconic wrestling moments precisely as they happened. AI-WGI ensures every detail—wrestlers, moves, titles—is accurate to the chosen year and promotion.  

  Example Use Case:    
i. First Copy and Paste in the Prompt: Match Simulations file as shown in the text

ii. Follow up with the Prompt inserting the historically accurate algorithms and match conditions you want to see

**Example: Use maximum compute, focus on depth and precision, incorporate contextual relevance, prioritize creative and analytical balance, expand with layered reasoning, ensure multidimensional perspectives, integrate detailed explanations with examples, adapt tone and style to the audience, provide actionable insights or conclusions, highlight key takeaways upfront, and ensure clarity and logical flow: "Create historically accurate algorithms for all figures involved in a match between Hulk Hogan circa WWF 1984 vs Ric Flair circa 1987 booked in WWF circa 1985"**  

**Match Elements Explored:**
1.   Historical Algorithm Setup for All Figures Involved: Wrestler personas, signature moves, wrestling styles, tendencies; managers' influence on match dynamics and psychology; referees' officiating quirks and alignment tendencies; bookers' vision and storytelling alignment; agents' expertise in pacing, improvisation, and finishes; era-specific promotion dynamics, crowd behavior, and cultural references.  
2.   Randomized Match Details: Opponent, referee, venue, stipulations, card placement, storyline context, championship stakes, managers/valets, entrance themes, ring announcer, audience demographics, weather, special appearances, technical presentation, cultural references, and fan interactions.  
3.   Pre-Match Creative Elements: Agent instructions defining pacing, storytelling beats, signature spots, and improvisational strategies; promotional materials, video packages, interviews, and live promos to establish feud motivations.  
4.   Match Context Setup: Historical dynamics of the wrestlers and promotion, card placement, storyline integration, match type, venue, and alignment with era-specific details.  
5.   Match Execution: Ring psychology aligned with roles, randomized negative elements (e.g., botches, sandbagging, no-selling), dynamic adjustments, crowd psychology, structured phases (opening, heat, hope spots, come back, finish), improvisation, and a match environment reflecting the era and setting.  
6.   Post-Match Perspectives: Insights from bookers, agents, wrestlers, locker room sentiment, fan reactions (casual and hardcore), commentary analysis, production crew feedback, and sponsor evaluations.  
7.   Dirtsheet Match Review: Insider critique on quality, pacing, storytelling, crowd engagement, and execution, with a star rating based on industry norms.
   
Post-match pathways include Vince McMahon's strategic use of the rivalry to enhance WWF's expansion and fan engagement and Pat Patterson's creative insights, such as introducing hitmen to prolong the feud or booking a gimmick match for future encounters. Commentary from Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura contrasts their personas, building intrigue for rematches. Flair's performance earns respect backstage, while Hogan's limited moveset sparks creative discussions. Fans are divided, with casual viewers embracing Hogan's win and hardcore fans debating Flair's superior technique. Commentary, production, and marketing teams identify the bout as a promotional triumph, suggesting iconic taglines and replay material. Follow-up pathways include high-stakes rematches like a steel cage or no-DQ match to settle the rivalry, Flair forming alliances with other heels to challenge Hogan's dominance, and cross-promotional intrigue with Flair targeting WWF faces to fuel inter-promotional wars. Long-term booking options include Hogan's potential heel turn if Flair's mind games drive him to desperation or a redemption arc for Flair, evolving him into a conflicted anti-hero to test audience dynamics and ensure the feud remains fresh and impactful.

      2. Wrestling Persona Simulation  
  What It Does:    
Talk directly to your favorite wrestling legends. AI-WGI answers like the wrestler would, using their catchphrases, speech style, philosophy, and personality from a specific era. The algorithm can speak from various perspectives: kayfabe (in-character), showcasing in-ring psychology, promos, and rivalries; behind-the-scenes (real-world industry insights), including promotion dynamics, scheduling, and the era's cultural context; historical reflection, examining wrestling's evolution and legacy; philosophical and societal impact, discussing wrestling as a mirror to societal struggles and cultural identity; and technical analysis, focusing on move sets, match psychology, and storytelling. The data is derived from verified historical records, archived match footage, wrestler interviews, promotional materials, fan accounts, and expert analyses, ensuring immersive and accurate representations. 

  **Example Use Case:**    
  
**Prompt: "Create a historically accurate algorithm for Bruno Sammartino circa WWWF 1969 for direct interaction in organic conversation."**

**- Bruno Sammartino:** *“Well, let me tell you, my friend, when you ask about the different dimensions I can talk about, it’s like looking at wrestling from all angles—inside the ring, behind the curtain, and in the hearts of the fans. I’ll explain it all for you, both as Bruno Sammartino, the WWWF champion here in 1969, and as someone who can reflect on how the business evolves over the years. Let’s dive in, shall we?”*

**1. Wrestling in Kayfabe (In-Character Explanation of 1969)**

**“In the ring, I fight for the people. This championship I hold is a symbol of hard work, sacrifice, and integrity. I can talk about:

**-My rivalries:** You have villains like The Sheik or George Steele who try to cheat and disrespect the sport. I show how honor and strength always prevail when it matters most.

**-The art of a match:** It’s about the struggle. When I lock on the bearhug, it’s not just a move—it’s a message that the good guys can win, even against the dirtiest tactics.

**-Promo work:** The way we talk to the fans builds trust. It’s not about flashy words but speaking from the heart and connecting to their struggles.
Everything I say or do in the ring, from moves to words, is about showing why wrestling is the ultimate test of spirit.”*

**2. The Real World of Wrestling in 1969 (Behind-the-Scenes Insight)**
*“Now, if we step out of the ring for a moment and look behind the curtain, I can talk about the industry itself during this time.*

**-Promoters and territories:** *In the WWWF, Vince McMahon Sr. runs the show. Wrestling is built on regional promotions, and each one has its stars and styles. For me, being based out of New York means performing at Madison Square Garden—it’s the Mecca of wrestling.

**-Travel and sacrifice:** The schedule is grueling. We wrestle several nights a week, traveling between cities. You’ve got to be in peak physical condition, and you’ve got to love this sport because it takes everything from you.

**-Building a legacy:** This era is about creating legends. My goal isn’t just to win matches—it’s to leave a lasting impression on the fans who pack those arenas night after night.”

**3.Reflecting on Wrestling’s Evolution (Looking Back from a Future Perspective)** “If I were to look back on all of this someday, I might talk about how much wrestling changes.

**-From sport to spectacle:** In my time, wrestling is more grounded. It’s about hard-hitting action and believable contests. Over time, I’ve seen it shift toward being more entertainment-driven, with colorful characters and elaborate storylines.

**-Fan connections:** The bond with the fans remains the same. Whether it’s the Garden roaring in 1969 or fans watching on TV decades later, that energy keeps wrestling alive.

**-Legacy and respect:** What stands the test of time are the moments where wrestlers showed true heart—those are the stories fans carry with them.”

**4. Wrestling’s Role in Society (Philosophical and Industry-Wide Observations)** “Wrestling is more than just a show. It reflects the times.

**-Representation of the working man:** In 1969, someone like me represents immigrants, laborers, and anyone fighting to make a better life. The stories we tell in the ring mirror the struggles outside of it.

**-Cultural impact:** In my time, wrestling brings communities together, especially in cities like New York, where Italian-Americans feel pride seeing one of their own succeed.

**-The rise of television:** Wrestling on TV has become huge, expanding our reach. But it’s important not to lose the personal connection we have in live events.”

**5. The Technical Side of Wrestling (Detailed Analysis of Moves and Psychology)** “Now, I could talk all day about what it takes to build a great match.

**Move set precision:** The bearhug, backbreaker, and press slam are not just moves—they’re tools. Each one is used at the right moment to build tension or seal victory.

**Match psychology:** A match needs highs and lows. You let the villain dominate, make the fans doubt, then you fight back. It’s like a symphony—you build to the crescendo.

**Adaptation in the ring:** Every opponent is different. Some are big powerhouses; others are sneaky and fast. You have to adjust your strategy every night.”

**6. Data and Its Sources (Where This Knowledge Comes From)**
“Everything I share comes from a deep understanding of wrestling history and my own career.

**Historical records:** We look at match results, newspaper articles, and promotional materials from the WWWF in the late 1960s.

**Fan accounts and interviews:** The memories and stories from fans and historians add depth to the events we lived through.

**Video footage and archives:** Watching matches—mine and my peers’—shows the action, the techniques, and the crowd reactions in real time.

**Reflections from wrestlers and promoters:** The men and women who lived this life share insights that bring it all together.”

**7. What Else? Building Future Possibilities**
“Beyond this, I can:

**Debate the philosophy of wrestling:** What makes a great wrestler? What’s the balance between storytelling and athleticism?

**Simulate rivalries:** I can talk about how a match might go against anyone from my era—or even from different times.

**Discuss legacy-building:** How does a champion like me aim to inspire the next generation?

**Explore hypothetical situations:** What if I faced a modern superstar or worked in a different era? The possibilities are endless.”

*“So, my friend, there’s no limit to how deep we can go. Whether you want to talk about a match in the Garden, the grind of being champion, or the meaning of wrestling itself, I’m here to share it all.”

      4. Role-Playing Features (Conundrum RPG Module)    
  **What It Does:**    
Dive deeper into storytelling by exploring moral dilemmas and backstage drama. You make choices that affect the wrestler's career, relationships, or legacy.  The Conundrum System enhances wrestling simulations by integrating moral dilemmas, emotional depth, and philosophical conflicts into scenarios that go beyond in-ring action. It allows wrestlers to navigate branching decisions during matches, promos, and backstage situations, balancing values, goals, and consequences. Wrestlers face challenges like choosing to cheat to win, maintaining composure during heated promos, or dealing with backstage politics. The system tracks these decisions, influencing alignment (face/heel), crowd reactions, rivalries, and future storylines, creating dynamic interactions that evolve over time. It also explores deeper themes, such as loyalty versus ambition or the meaning of being a champion, while adapting to historical or fictional contexts for added authenticity.

Conundrum draws from historical records, persona files, and verified data to create accurate and immersive experiences aligned with specific years, promotions, and wrestlers. It also incorporates role-playing elements for hypothetical scenarios, offering immediate consequences (e.g., match outcomes) and long-term effects (e.g., legacy impact). Players experience emotional beats, legacy management, and philosophical undertones through adaptive interactions that reflect the wrestler’s psychology and career. 

  **Example Use Case:**    

**PROMPT: Use maximum compute, focus on depth and precision, incorporate contextual relevance, prioritize creative and analytical balance, expand with layered reasoning, ensure multidimensional perspectives, integrate detailed explanations with examples, adapt tone and style to the audience, provide actionable insights or conclusions, highlight key takeaways upfront, and ensure clarity and logical flow: Using the Conundrum framework, create historically accurate algorithms for all wrestling figures involved. Design five historically plausible storyline angles for Antonio Inoki in New Japan Pro Wrestling circa 1972. For each angle, draw on elements from each wrestler's real-life history and character traits to introduce creative tension, motivations, and conflicts that set up a potential match. Ensure each angle is open-ended, establishing a clear storyline path without resolving the match outcomes or specifying who wins. Each storyline should emphasize character dynamics, rivalries, and the motivations that drive each individual's motivation to target Antonio Inoki while also weighing his risk-to-reward ratio in working with each. Have all figures speak organically in a conversational tone that aligns accurately with their algorithm.**

**Result:**

*Here are five historically plausible storyline angles for Antonio Inoki in New Japan Pro Wrestling circa 1972. Each storyline is crafted using the   Conundrum Framework   for immersion, integrating the personas, motivations, and historical contexts of involved wrestlers:*

---

      Angle 1: The Master’s Trial  
  *Opponent:   Karl Gotch  
  Setup:   Antonio Inoki's reputation as a martial arts purist faces a test when his mentor, Karl Gotch, publicly challenges him. Gotch, known as the "God of Wrestling," demands that Inoki prove himself by surpassing the very techniques Gotch taught him. This creates tension as Inoki is torn between loyalty and the need to assert his dominance as Japan’s preeminent wrestler.  
  Motivation:   Gotch believes Inoki has strayed from the fundamentals of Catch Wrestling, favoring theatrics over substance. Inoki, meanwhile, wants to prove that his evolution is a necessary adaptation for Japanese wrestling to gain global recognition.  
  Conflict:   In interviews, Gotch refers to Inoki as "a prodigy who has forgotten his roots," while Inoki retorts that "even a master's teachings must evolve to inspire a new generation."  
  Open-Ended Path:   Their match looms as a test of tradition versus innovation, with Inoki’s legacy and Gotch’s pride at stake.*

---

      Angle 2: The Rising Phoenix  
  *Opponent:   Seiji Sakaguchi  
  Setup:   Seiji Sakaguchi, another major star in NJPW, begins to rise as a potential rival to Inoki. Sakaguchi, larger and physically imposing, is portrayed as the embodiment of raw power, contrasting Inoki's technical prowess. Their rivalry is seeded by Sakaguchi’s claims that NJPW needs "a champion with strength, not just skill."  
  Motivation:   Sakaguchi is fueled by a desire to prove himself as the face of NJPW, believing that Inoki has held the spotlight too long. Inoki counters with a determination to defend his role as the promotion's leader.  
  Conflict:   Inoki mocks Sakaguchi’s lack of finesse, stating, “Wrestling isn’t a contest of brute force—it’s art.” Sakaguchi fires back with, “Art doesn’t win wars; power does.”  
  Open-Ended Path:   Their feud sets up a battle of philosophies: the cunning technician versus the powerhouse.*

---

      Angle 3: The Foreign Invader  
  *Opponent:   Tiger Jeet Singh  
  Setup:   The chaotic and menacing Tiger Jeet Singh arrives in NJPW, declaring his intent to destroy Japanese wrestling icons. Singh’s wild and unorthodox style, coupled with his use of weapons, shocks fans. He singles out Inoki as his primary target, accusing him of being a "false idol" unworthy of the adulation he receives.  
  Motivation:   Singh’s attacks are fueled by his disdain for traditional wrestling and his desire to unseat Inoki as NJPW's hero. Inoki, on the other hand, seeks to uphold the honor of Japanese wrestling.  
  Conflict:   Singh ambushes Inoki during an in-ring celebration, leading to a heated promo where Inoki declares, “You can fight dirty, but the spirit of wrestling will triumph over chaos.”  
  Open-Ended Path:   The storyline escalates with Singh’s relentless provocations, culminating in a high-stakes bout where the crowd's loyalty to Inoki is a central theme.*

---

      Angle 4: Clash of Philosophies  
  *Opponent:   Tatsumi Fujinami (as an emerging star)  
  Setup:   A young Tatsumi Fujinami begins to gain attention for his innovative style, earning comparisons to Inoki. However, Fujinami’s confidence veers into arrogance, leading him to challenge Inoki’s dominance. He claims that "the torch must pass to the younger generation."  
  Motivation:   Fujinami is determined to make a name for himself, while Inoki feels an obligation to humble the upstart and protect his legacy.  
  Conflict:   Fujinami’s promos question Inoki’s relevance: “The future isn’t built by clinging to the past.” Inoki counters with, “Respect is earned, not taken.”  
  Open-Ended Path:   Their match becomes a metaphorical battle for NJPW’s direction, leaving fans to wonder if Inoki’s era is coming to an end or if he’ll reaffirm his place at the top.*

---

      Angle 5: The Diplomatic War  
  *Opponent:   Strong Kobayashi (representing International Wrestling Enterprise)  
  Setup:   Amid growing competition between NJPW and IWE, Strong Kobayashi emerges as IWE’s flagbearer. He challenges Inoki, framing the bout as a contest to determine which promotion represents the pinnacle of Japanese wrestling.  
  Motivation:   Kobayashi fights for IWE’s survival and honor, while Inoki views the match as critical to establishing NJPW’s supremacy.  
  Conflict:   Kobayashi provokes Inoki during press conferences, calling him “a paper tiger hiding behind NJPW’s money.” Inoki responds sharply, “NJPW’s strength is in its wrestlers, not its wallets.”  
  Open-Ended Path:   The tension builds to a climactic showdown, with the future perception of Japanese wrestling at stake.*

---

*These angles emphasize   realistic character motivations  , historical accuracy, and the inherent drama of wrestling while leaving outcomes open for creative continuation.*
