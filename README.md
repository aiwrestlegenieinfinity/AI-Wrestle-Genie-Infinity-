  Example Use Case:    
You ask: "What would a match between Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair look like in 1985 WWF?"

      2. Wrestling Persona Simulation  
  What It Does:    
Talk directly to your favorite wrestling legends. AI-WGI answers like the wrestler would, using their catchphrases, speech style, and personality from a specific era.  

  Example Use Case:    
You ask: "What advice would The Rock give in 1999 for cutting a promo?"   
- AI-WGI responds in The Rock's iconic tone, like: "First, jabroni, know your role and shut your mouth. Second, bring the electricity because the millions (and millions!) of The Rock's fans demand it!"
