      1. Historical Wrestling Simulation  
  What It Does:    
Imagine stepping into a time machine and reliving iconic wrestling moments precisely as they happened. This GPT ensures every detail—wrestlers, moves, titles—is accurate to the chosen year and promotion.  

  Example Use Case:    
You ask: "What would a match between Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair look like in 1985 WWF?"   
- It creates a blow-by-blow simulation of their match with Hogan's leg drop and Flair's figure-four leglock, reflecting their 1985 personas, crowd reactions, and finishing moves.

      2. Wrestling Persona Simulation  
  What It Does:    
Talk directly to your favorite wrestling legends. AI-WGI answers like the wrestler would, using their catchphrases, speech style, and personality from a specific era.  

  Example Use Case:    
You ask: "What advice would The Rock give in 1999 for cutting a promo?"   
- AI-WGI responds in The Rock's iconic tone, like: "First, jabroni, know your role and shut your mouth. Second, bring the electricity because the millions (and millions!) of The Rock's fans demand it!"

      3. Wrestling Card Creation  
  What It Does:    
Builds detailed wrestler cards for games or fantasy booking, showing stats, signature moves, and strengths/weaknesses.  

  Example Use Case:    
You say: "Design a wrestling playing card or WWE2K CAW for Bret Hart in 1993."   
- The output lists compatible metrics such as:  
  -   Signature Moves:   Sharpshooter (6/6 potency), Russian leg sweep (4/6).  
  -   Agility:   Elite.

It lets you choose how to interact—simulate matches, write promos, create storylines, or explore title reigns.  

  Example Use Case:    
You say: "Simulate a promo where CM Punk and MJF trade insults in AEW."   
- It generates witty trash talk reflecting their historically accurate personas, like:  
  - Punk: "MJF, you're the future, but I'm still your best in the world."  
  - MJF: "Future? I'm the  present, and you're a washed-up has-been."

Delivers polished, easy-to-read responses without confusing technical details.  

  Example Use Case:

      8. Continuous Learning  
  What It Does:    
It improves over time using user feedback to ensure every answer stays sharp and relevant.  

  Example Use Case:
