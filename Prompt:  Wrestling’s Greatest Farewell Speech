Prompt:  Wrestling’s Greatest Farewell Speech  

Create only real-life historically accurate algorithms for all wrestling figures and elements involved. Using verified references, simulate the final in-ring promo of a real-life wrestler, incorporating their promotion, year, and historical context as they retire. Include the following elements:

     1.   Career Reflections & Context  :
   - Detail title runs, iconic feuds, and personal struggles that defined their career.
   - Integrate the era’s promotional landscape and its influence on their journey (e.g., territorial wrestling, Monday Night Wars).

     2.   Layered Emotional Interactions  :
   - Address the crowd with gratitude, humor, or raw honesty, sharing memorable road stories or personal milestones.
   - Illustrate fan reactions (chants, signs, or moments of silence) that reflect their legacy’s emotional weight.

     3.   Acknowledgment of Rivals & Allies  :
   - Narrate how rivals and allies respond, from heartfelt tributes to playful jabs or reconciliations.
   - Reference pivotal rivalries or partnerships, bringing them full circle in this final chapter.

     4.   Audience & Industry Reactions  :
   - Weave in commentary from broadcasters, emphasizing their contributions to the business.
   - Include backstage sentiments or how the wrestling media and fans react (era-appropriate, e.g., newsletters or social media).

     5.   Surprise Post-Speech Moment  :
   - Introduce a dramatic twist: an unannounced guest, a final angle, or an endorsement from a key figure.
   - Decide whether this twist sets up a storyline or serves as an emotional highlight.

     6.   Post-Retirement Legacy  :
   - Speculate on the wrestler’s post-retirement plans (trainer, promoter, commentator).
   - Highlight their Hall of Fame eligibility, lasting influence, or tributes from wrestlers inspired by them.

     7.   Real-Life Context  :
   - Include personal challenges (injuries, financial woes, backstage politics) that shaped their journey.
   - Examine how broader cultural or industry shifts influenced their character and style.

     8.   Fan-Centric Closure  :
   - Capture interactions where fans break kayfabe to honor the wrestler’s legacy.
   - Reference fan traditions (chants, thank-you moments) specific to the era or promotion.

    Goal:
Create a deeply authentic and historically rich farewell promo blending heartfelt nostalgia, drama, and realism. Reflect on real achievements, relationships, and industry contributions, leaving fans with an unforgettable moment that resonates emotionally and historically.

    How to Use:
- Contextualize: Choose a wrestler, year, and promotion (e.g., NJPW 2010, WWF 1992).
- Customize: Replace generic placeholders with specifics from the wrestler’s career and era.
- Expand: Add subplots—such as family involvement, surprise appearances, or thematic callbacks—to enhance immersion and emotional depth.”
