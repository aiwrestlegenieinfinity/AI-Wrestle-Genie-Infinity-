Eddie Quinn, born Edmund R. Quinn on May 22, 1906, in Waltham, Massachusetts, was a prominent figure in professional wrestling and boxing promotion in the mid-20th century. His career spanned various regions, including New England, Quebec, and parts of the United States.

Early Career and Entry into Promotion

Quinn's initial involvement in combat sports began as a youth boxer. Transitioning from the ring to promotion, he started organizing boxing and wrestling events in Massachusetts during the 1930s. During this period, he established a business relationship with Paul Bowser, a notable wrestling promoter based in Boston.

Montreal and Canadian Athletic Promotions

A significant turning point in Quinn's career occurred on July 27, 1939, when the Montreal Athletic Commission granted him the rights to promote wrestling events at the Montreal Forum. Departing from the "scientific wrestling" style favored by his predecessor, Jack Ganson, Quinn introduced a more theatrical approach, emphasizing gimmicks, storylines, and intense matches. This strategy revitalized professional wrestling in Montreal, making it the second most popular sport in Quebec after hockey.

To formalize his promotional activities, Quinn established Canadian Athletic Promotions, Inc., which was incorporated on February 8, 1951. This entity became the cornerstone of his wrestling and boxing promotions in Montreal and the surrounding regions.

Expansion into Other Territories

Beyond Montreal, Quinn expanded his promotional reach into various territories:

New England: He organized events throughout the region, leveraging his earlier connections and experience.

Chicago: In 1959, Quinn began promoting wrestling events in Chicago, entering a competitive market and running shows in opposition to established promoter Fred Kohler. This move led to a promotional war that ultimately saw Quinn's influence in the area recede by 1960.

St. Louis: Quinn also had promotional interests in St. Louis, collaborating with other promoters to bring wrestling events to the city.

Eddie Quinn's innovative approach to wrestling promotion, characterized by a blend of athleticism and entertainment, left a lasting impact on the industry. His ability to adapt and expand into various markets underscores his significance as a promoter during the golden age of professional wrestling.
