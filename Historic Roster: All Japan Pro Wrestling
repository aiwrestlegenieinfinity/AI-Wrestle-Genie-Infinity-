All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) was founded in 1972 by Shohei "Giant" Baba after splitting from Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA). Initially aligned with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), AJPW brought major international stars to Japan, solidifying its reputation for featuring high-quality wrestling. The promotion was known for its emphasis on strong, athletic matches rather than gimmicks, embodying a "King's Road" style characterized by hard-hitting strikes, technical prowess, and dramatic storytelling.

In the 1980s, AJPW rose to prominence through the performances of stars like Jumbo Tsuruta, Genichiro Tenryu, and Stan Hansen. The 1990s marked the promotion’s golden era, led by the legendary "Four Pillars of Heaven" — Mitsuharu Misawa, Kenta Kobashi, Toshiaki Kawada, and Akira Taue. These wrestlers defined the style of the promotion, engaging in highly acclaimed matches that set new standards for in-ring excellence.

Following the death of Giant Baba in 1999, the company faced turmoil, leading to a mass exodus of talent in 2000 led by Misawa, who formed Pro Wrestling NOAH. Despite this, AJPW continued under the leadership of Motoko Baba, and later, Keiji Mutoh, who brought a new direction by mixing traditional AJPW elements with a more modern style. The company has since undergone various ownership changes but remains active, maintaining its legacy through events that honor its storied past and showcase current talents.
