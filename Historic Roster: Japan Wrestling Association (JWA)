The Japanese Wrestling Association (JWA) was Japan's first professional wrestling promotion, founded in 1953 by Rikidōzan , widely regarded as the father of puroresu (Japanese pro wrestling). It was the dominant organization throughout the 1950s and 1960s, introducing the sport to Japanese audiences and laying the groundwork for the industry.

Key Phases:

1. Founding and Early Success (1953 1960s) :
JWA was established by Rikidōzan after his success as a professional wrestler. He brought in popular American wrestlers to face Japanese talents, generating significant fan interest.
Rikidōzan’s matches, especially against foreign competitors like Lou Thesz and The Destroyer, boosted the promotion's popularity. He became a national hero, symbolizing post war recovery.

2. Golden Age and Expansion (1960s) :
After Rikidōzan’s tragic death in 1963 , the JWA continued to grow, led by stars like Giant Baba and Antonio Inoki . The promotion dominated Japanese wrestling and secured partnerships with promotions in the United States.
The JWA created prestigious titles such as the NWA International Heavyweight Championship , further elevating its status.

3. Decline and Internal Struggles (Late 1960s 1970s) :
Tensions between Giant Baba and Antonio Inoki led to a split, with both wrestlers having different visions for the company. Inoki was expelled from the JWA in 1971 and went on to form New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) .
In 1972 , Giant Baba left to create All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) , taking many top talents with him. The departure of these key figures weakened the JWA significantly.

4. Collapse (1973) :
The loss of Baba and Inoki led to a severe decline in the JWA's popularity and financial troubles. The promotion struggled to maintain its dominance and relevance without its biggest stars.
In April 1973 , the JWA was officially dissolved, marking the end of Japan's first major wrestling promotion.

Legacy:
The JWA set the stage for modern puroresu, inspiring the rise of new promotions like NJPW and AJPW , which continued to build on the foundations laid by Rikidōzan and the JWA. The influence of the JWA is still felt today, as it was crucial in establishing wrestling as a major entertainment form in Japan.
