   -   Historical Year & Setting  : Specify the real-world wrestling climate—title pictures, roster depth, rival promotions—that sets the stage for the comeback.  
   -   Cultural Influences  : Mention any relevant social or pop-culture factors shaping fan expectations (attitudes toward kayfabe, the popularity of certain match types, or the media’s coverage of pro wrestling).

2.   Teasing and Foreshadowing    
   -   Cryptic Vignettes  : Script short teasers (TV spots, social media hints) or cameo sightings that stoke fan curiosity.  
   -   Media Speculation  : Highlight how insiders (magazines, early internet boards, or modern social media) debate the possibility of a surprise return, analyzing old injuries or rumored backstage tensions.

3.   Fan and Roster Reactions    
   -   Positive vs. Negative Reception  : Some fans might cheer a nostalgic hero, others might resent them overshadowing new talent.  
   -   Locker Room Dynamics  : Let mid-carders or younger stars feel threatened, while longtime peers either welcome or distrust the returning veteran.

4.   First Promo    
   -   Grand Reveal  : Detail how the wrestler finally appears—interrupting a main event, popping up unannounced during an interview, or getting introduced by an authority figure.  
   -   Motivations & Absence Explanation  : Have them address the reasons for stepping away (injuries, personal matters, creative disagreements) while staying within kayfabe boundaries.

5.   Marquee Match & Storyline    
   -   High-Stakes Angle  : Plan a major match or feud that reestablishes the wrestler’s ring prowess. Could it be a title chase, a personal grudge angle, or a career redemption arc?  
   -   Challenges of Ring Rust  : Show how the returning star navigates new styles, updated rosters, or a faster pace. Possibly highlight a mentor or manager helping them adapt.

6.   Long-Term Story Arc    
   -   6–12 Month Narrative  : Outline key arcs—like initial triumphs, subsequent setbacks, alliance-building, or teased heel turns.  
   -   Historical Rivalries  : Incorporate references to old feuds that resurface, fueling tension or nostalgia-laced matchups.

7.   Backstage and Industry Impact    
   -   Rival Promotions’ Response  : Maybe a competitor tries to lure them away, or runs a smear campaign questioning their loyalty.  
   -   Journalists’ Takes  : Simulate quotes from known wrestling reporters or columnists analyzing the wrestler’s potential success, ring condition, or locker-room influence.

8.   Emotional Beats    
   -   Personal Struggles  : If the wrestler overcame injuries or personal demons, let them reference this in promos or fleeting backstage moments.  
   -   Legacy-Defining Moments  : Build up to a critical match or angle that cements the star’s new role—legendary comeback or bittersweet farewell.

9.   Accuracy and Immersion    
   -   Real Roster Integration  : Use verifiable names, movesets, and known alliances or feuds from the era.  
   -   Era-Specific Production  : If it’s the ’80s, mention simpler entrance sets and local TV coverage; if it’s the 2010s, highlight pyro, TitanTron videos, or social media campaigns.
