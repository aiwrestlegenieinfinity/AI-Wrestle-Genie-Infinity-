Wrestler vs. Commentator Feud 

Prompt: "Create only real-life historically accurate algorithms for all wrestling figures and elements involved. Craft an in-depth storyline featuring a   real-life wrestler   and a   real-life commentator   from a Specific Year & Promotion. The conflict escalates from on-air critiques to a full-blown match, grounding every element in   era-specific   booking trends, cultural context, and real-world wrestling details. Incorporate the points below for a layered, immersive narrative:

1.   Context and Characters    
   -   Year & Promotion  : Outline the historical wrestling climate—major storylines, typical booking philosophies, prominent rosters.  
   -   Wrestler Bio  : Detail the wrestler’s alignment (face/heel/tweener), ring style, signature moves, relevant feuds, and real-life persona.  
   -   Commentator Persona  : Identify the commentator’s usual on-air style—sarcastic color commentary, a by-the-book sports approach, or comedic flair. Include known real-life accolades or controversies.

2.   Inciting Conflict    
   -   Critical Comments  : The commentator crosses a line, making harsh critiques or mocking the wrestler’s recent performance, personal life, or ring style.  
   -   Backstage Tension  : Weave in short vignettes of the wrestler hearing about these jabs, fueling resentment or comedic banter if they’re more laid-back.  
   -   Era-Specific Social/Media Reaction  : If it’s older territory days, mention newsletter gossip; if modern, highlight social media trending or blog speculation about the simmering conflict.

3.   Promos and Confrontations    
   -   On-Air Segments  : Have the wrestler confront the commentator during a broadcast—cutting an impromptu promo or intervening while they’re at the commentary table.  
   -   Backstage Interviews  : Let each party defend their position, with the commentator possibly claiming they’re just doing their job, and the wrestler seeing it as a personal attack.  
   -   Promotional Build  : Include cameo remarks from fellow wrestlers or authority figures who spark or attempt to quell the feud.

4.   Stipulation Match Announcement    
   -   Authority Decision  : Present a storyline reason how the commentator ends up forced into the ring—fan demand, a storyline punishment, or the commentator’s misguided confidence.  
   -   Match Type  : If it’s territory-era, a simple one-on-one might suffice; for an Attitude Era vibe, you could choose a No DQ or Hardcore match to up the spectacle.  
   -   Expectation Setting  : Show how the commentator might train (comically or earnestly) or rely on a manager or stable for protection.

5.   Match Psychology and Execution    
   -   Early Spots  : Portray how the commentator tries to avoid direct contact or employs comedic tactics. The wrestler might toy with them initially or be furious, going in for a quick beatdown.  
   -   Mid-Match Developments  : Incorporate run-ins (if era-appropriate), illusions of the commentator almost scoring an upset pin, or comedic near-misses.  
   -   Finish  : Decide if it’s a decisive win for the wrestler, a shocking fluke for the commentator, or a controversial outcome that sets up a sequel angle.

6.   Post-Match Fallout    
   -   Character Shifts  : If the commentator is humbled, they might shift alignment or show new respect. If the wrestler lost, they might spiral or gain sympathy.  
   -   Promotion Impact  : Reflect how the story changes the locker room dynamic—do other wrestlers mock the loser, or does the winner pivot toward a new feud, referencing the commentator match?  
   -   Long-Term Storylines  : Tease future angles—maybe the commentator holds a grudge or becomes a manager, or the wrestler shifts focus onto a bigger rivalry after proving a point.

7.   Era-Appropriate Dialogue and Culture    
   -   Language & References  : Ensure each promo snippet uses the period’s style—80s territory folksy mic talk, 90s edgy catchphrases, or modern shoot-style remarks.  
   -   Cultural Ties  : If set in Japan, mention a respectful approach to tradition; if in Mexico, incorporate lucha libre showmanship; if it’s a Western mainstream promotion, highlight the big entrance pop or TitanTron vignettes.

8.   Conundrum Role-Playing (Optional)    
   -   Ethical Dilemmas  : Let the user or GM decide if the wrestler punishes the commentator beyond reason or if the commentator cheats using a foreign object.  
   -   Emotional Beats  : Introduce personal stakes—a friend of the commentator tries to intervene, or the wrestler’s mentor warns them about losing focus on more critical feuds.

9.   Conclusion and Future Hooks    
   -   Reflections  : Depict how the commentator spins the post-match result on air, or how the wrestler references it in upcoming promos.  
   -   Possible Next Feuds  : Start seeds of bigger angles—like a main-event star confronting the returning commentator in support or scorn of the wrestler’s actions, or the commentator revealing inside dirt on more top wrestlers.
