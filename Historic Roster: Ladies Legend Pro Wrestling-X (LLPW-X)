Ladies Legend Pro Wrestling X (LLPW X) is a women's professional wrestling promotion in Japan that was established in 1992. Initially known as LLPW , the promotion was founded by wrestler Shinobu Kandori after the dissolution of Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (JWP), following a split from the All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (AJW) system. Kandori aimed to create a promotion that would emphasize a blend of traditional pro wrestling and martial arts elements, reflecting her own background.

Key Eras and Evolution :

1990s (Foundation and Early Years) : LLPW was one of the major women's promotions during the Joshi boom of the early '90s, alongside AJW, JWP, and others. The promotion distinguished itself with a unique mix of wrestling and shoot fighting styles. Shinobu Kandori became the top star and focal point, known for her tough, legitimate fighting background. LLPW focused on smaller scale shows but gained attention through inter promotional events and rivalries, particularly those with AJW, JWP, and FMW (Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling).

2000s (Struggles and Adaptations) : The decline of the Joshi wrestling scene in the late '90s and early 2000s led to challenges for many promotions, including LLPW. During this period, LLPW focused on smaller venues and continued to emphasize a mix of professional wrestling and mixed martial arts, with a greater focus on shoot style matches. The promotion survived largely due to the dedicated fan base and periodic collaborations with other women's wrestling companies.

2010s (Rebranding to LLPW X) : In the 2010s, the promotion rebranded as LLPW X, reflecting a shift toward a more diverse and entertainment oriented approach. This era saw a mix of traditional wrestling, MMA style bouts, and entertainment matches. They also sought to revive interest by bringing in new talents and holding special reunion events with legends of the Joshi scene.

Current Day : LLPW X continues to operate, albeit on a smaller scale than during its peak years. The promotion remains known for its distinctive blend of styles and has maintained a loyal following. Occasionally, it hosts events featuring veterans and legends of Joshi wrestling, along with showcasing newer talent who embody the spirit of the original LLPW.

Legacy : LLPW X's contribution to women's wrestling is marked by its resilience and distinct approach to blending wrestling and martial arts. Despite the changing landscape, it remains a testament to the diverse styles within Japanese women's wrestling and the legacy of its founder, Shinobu Kandori.
