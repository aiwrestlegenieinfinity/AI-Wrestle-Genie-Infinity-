   -   Hypothetical Reunion  : Craft a scene where the wrestler meets old peers or promoters, discussing “what might have been” had they stayed on the original track.  
   -   Meta Commentary  : Let rivals or allies weigh in, offering alternate perspectives on whether the decision made pro wrestling better, worse, or simply different.

7.   Enhanced Verification and Immersion

   -   Era-Specific Language and Moves  : Reflect commentary jargons, ring psychology, and finishing maneuvers characteristic of the chosen time.

   -   Final Assessment  : Summarize how the wrestler’s altered journey reshaped the wrestling landscape—did it birth new legends, overshadow others, or transform entire promotions?  
   -   Lessons Learned  : Offer insights on the interplay between personal ambition and the communal nature of pro wrestling storytelling.
