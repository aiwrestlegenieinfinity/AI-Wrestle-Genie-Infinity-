Wrestling Press Conference Simulation

Prompt:   Create real-life historically accurate algorithms for all wrestling figures and elements involved. Simulate a historically accurate kayfabe press conference involving real-life random Wrestlers/Managers/Authority Figures, from a Specific Year & Promotion, reflecting   era-appropriate   language, character alignments, and ongoing storylines. Integrate the elements below for a fully immersive narrative:

1.   Participants & Personas    
   -   Roster Overview  : Name each wrestler or manager, specifying their alignment (face, heel, tweener), known feuds, or alliances.  
   -   Authority Figures  : Include promoters, commissioners, or GMs relevant to the era, with real backstage influence if historically documented.  
   -   Character-Specific Details  : Emphasize each participant’s typical mic style (e.g., calm and calculated, brash and explosive) and any storyline baggage (injuries, title frustrations, personal rivalries).

2.   Dynamic Interactions    
   -   Journalist Engagement  : Draft a set of questions probing match strategies, personal motivations, or emotional stakes, ensuring each question challenges the wrestlers’ story arcs.  
   -   Era-Specific Language  : Have wrestlers respond with slang or phrasing that fits their era’s norms (territory-era southern drawl vs. modern reality-based promos).  
   -   Heated Exchanges  : Script interruptions or unplanned run-ins—like a bitter rival crashing the conference or a manager unveiling new evidence of cheating.

3.   Tension & Conflict    
   -   Emotional Hooks  : Show how certain questions poke at raw nerves—maybe referencing a recent betrayal, a disputed finish, or a humiliating loss.  
   -   Authority Figure Announcements  : Surprise participants by revealing new stipulations, championship match changes, or brand invasions that intensify the press conference drama.  
   -   Potential Brawl  : Tease or imply physical confrontations—guards or referees stepping in to separate wrestlers who nearly come to blows.

4.   Backdrop & Environment    
   -   Authentic Setting  : Describe the location—small gym vs. upscale hotel banquet room—matching the chosen era’s typical press event style.  
   -   Storyline Relevance  : Tie the conference’s timing to an upcoming big show, tournament, or brand new belt unveiling, so every question is tied to a bigger payoff.  
   -   Crowd Dynamics  : If fans are present, integrate cheers, jeers, or chants. For more exclusive press events, keep a hush of scribbling journalists or camera flashes.

5.   Philosophical Layers    
   -   Core Themes  : Weave in deeper questions about loyalty, tradition vs. innovation, or the nature of sports entertainment.  
   -   Moral Debates  : Have a face champion question a heel’s reliance on dirty tactics, or a tweener rationalize bending rules for personal gain.

6.   Surprises & Consequences    
   -   Shocking Twists  : Let a masked newcomer interrupt to challenge the top star, or a longstanding manager turn on their client mid-conference.  
   -   Cliffhanger Endings  : Conclude the conference abruptly—someone gets slapped, or an authority figure shuts down further questions, leaving fans guessing about the fallout.

7.   Hype Building    
   -   Promotional Materials  : Reference official event posters, teasers, or next-week TV segments that keep the hype strong post-conference.  
   -   Character Teasers  : Let wrestlers drop subtle hints about future alliances or finisher reveals, enticing fans to tune in for more.  
   -   Era-Specific Media  : If it’s modern, mention live tweeting or streaming reactions. For older eras, revolve around print magazines or local TV highlight reels capturing the drama.

8.   Optional Interactive Role-Playing    
   -   User Toggles  : Let the user pick conundrum modes (e.g., moral dilemmas, deeper emotional reveals) or intensity levels (friendly banter vs. savage shoot comments).  
   -   Multiple Outcomes  : Offer different paths if certain questions trigger a meltdown or if authority figures intervene more forcefully.
