Founding and Early Years  

       Industry Context  
In   1992  , the Mexican wrestling industry was dominated by   Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL)  , the oldest wrestling promotion in the world. While CMLL maintained a stronghold on traditional lucha libre, its creative direction had become somewhat stagnant, with rigid booking practices and limited opportunities for innovation. This environment inspired   Antonio Peña  , who envisioned a dynamic alternative that could attract younger fans and create opportunities for wrestlers seeking more creative freedom.

The period also saw the growing influence of American promotions like   WCW   and   WWF  , which showcased larger-than-life characters and television-centric storytelling. Peña aimed to combine the theatricality of international wrestling with the athleticism and cultural identity of lucha libre, offering a product that appealed both to traditional Mexican fans and a broader global audience.
