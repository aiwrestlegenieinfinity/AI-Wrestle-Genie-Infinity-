World Woman Pro Wrestling Diana (Diana) Brief History

Founded in 2011 by legendary wrestler Kyoko Inoue , Diana emerged as a Japanese women's professional wrestling promotion. Based in Kawasaki, Kanagawa , it was established as a platform to promote women's wrestling and provide opportunities for new and veteran talent. The promotion quickly developed a niche, focusing on a mix of traditional Joshi wrestling and incorporating elements to appeal to both older and newer audiences.

Early Years (2011 2014):
Kyoko Inoue, a significant figure in the history of Joshi Puroresu, formed Diana following her departure from NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling. Initially, the promotion faced challenges in establishing a stable roster and maintaining regular events. However, Inoue’s reputation and connections helped attract talent and build credibility. Diana hosted smaller events in community centers and smaller venues around Kanagawa and Tokyo.

Expansion and Growth (2015 2018):
During this period, Diana began to gain traction, expanding its roster and establishing regular events. Wrestlers such as Meiko Tanaka , Ayako Sato , and Kris Wolf played critical roles in building the brand. The promotion also engaged in collaborative events with other promotions like SEAdLINNNG , Marvelous , and Pro Wrestling WAVE , further strengthening its visibility in the Joshi scene. They also held championship tournaments, increasing competition and storylines that attracted dedicated fans.

Current Era (2019 Present):
Diana continues to operate, albeit with a smaller profile compared to larger promotions like Stardom . It serves as a training ground for emerging talent while maintaining a roster of seasoned veterans. Diana’s approach emphasizes traditional, technical wrestling styles, along with mixed matches and tag teams. They also host special events and tournaments to keep fans engaged, celebrating notable anniversaries and occasionally collaborating with promotions outside Japan.

Despite its size, Diana has maintained a stable presence in the Joshi wrestling world. With Kyoko Inoue still playing an active role both behind the scenes and in the ring, the promotion exemplifies a classic yet resilient approach to women's professional wrestling in Japan.
