NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling (NEO) was a women's professional wrestling promotion in Japan that operated from 1997 to 2010. It was founded by Kyoko Inoue, a prominent figure in the joshi wrestling scene, after the closure of All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (AJW). NEO was established as a platform for wrestlers to continue their careers amidst the decline of traditional joshi promotions.

Early Years (1997 2000) : NEO was created following the collapse of AJW, and Kyoko Inoue, along with other veterans, played a central role in maintaining joshi wrestling's presence. It offered a mix of experienced wrestlers and new talent, aiming to preserve the spirit of classic joshi wrestling.

Growth and Expansion (2001 2007) : During this period, NEO developed its unique identity, featuring hard hitting matches, strong storytelling, and prominent rivalries. It became a hub for established stars and up and coming wrestlers. The promotion built a reputation for fostering new talent while maintaining a roster of seasoned performers.

Final Years and Closure (2008 2010) : Despite its contributions to the joshi scene, NEO faced financial challenges as the wrestling industry shifted. On December 31, 2010, NEO held its final event, marking the end of a 13 year run. Kyoko Inoue's decision to close the promotion was due to the difficulty of sustaining it financially, although she continued her involvement in wrestling through other ventures.

Throughout its existence, NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling was known for its resilience, dedication to the craft, and the nurturing of new talent, leaving a lasting legacy in the world of joshi wrestling.
