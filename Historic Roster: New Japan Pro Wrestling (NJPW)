Founding and Early Years (1972-1978)
New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) was founded on January 13, 1972, by Antonio Inoki, a legendary Japanese wrestler and promoter. Inoki, who had gained fame during his time with the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA), established NJPW after leaving JWA, which soon dissolved. The promotion quickly gained attention due to Inoki's charisma and his philosophy of "Strong Style," which emphasized realistic, martial arts-influenced wrestling.

In its early years, NJPW focused on international partnerships to build its roster and audience. It established alliances with American promotions like the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), bringing in international stars to compete in Japan. Inoki's high-profile matches against international fighters, including martial artists and pro wrestlers, helped elevate the company's status. One of the most famous was Inoki's match against Muhammad Ali in 1976, which was a precursor to modern MMA.

Expansion and the 1980s Boom (1979-1989)
Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, NJPW continued to grow, and Antonio Inoki became a household name in Japan. During this time, NJPW produced stars like Tatsumi Fujinami, who became a prominent figure in the promotion's Junior Heavyweight division. The division was innovative, combining high-flying moves with traditional Japanese wrestling, and it introduced international stars like Tiger Mask, Dynamite Kid, and others.

The 1980s also saw NJPW expand its partnerships with American and Mexican promotions, including World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). This led to cross-promotional events and exchange of talent, broadening NJPW's global influence. The company's success was solidified when it created the International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) Heavyweight Championship in 1987, which became its primary title.

The Three Musketeers Era and Transition (1990-1999)
The 1990s marked a transitional period for NJPW. Antonio Inoki began to step away from active competition, and a new generation of stars emerged, notably "The Three Musketeers": Keiji Mutoh (The Great Muta), Masahiro Chono, and Shinya Hashimoto. Each of these wrestlers brought their own style, from Mutoh's high-flying and technical abilities to Chono's charisma and Hashimoto's hard-hitting, strong style. This trio helped carry NJPW into a new era, maintaining its status as Japan's leading wrestling promotion.

During this time, NJPW also explored more ambitious booking and storytelling, introducing elements of factional warfare that would later become a staple. It further diversified its roster by bringing in more international talents, including stars from the U.S. and Mexico, maintaining a dynamic roster of both heavyweight and junior heavyweight wrestlers.

Inoki-ism and the MMA Influence (2000-2006)
The early 2000s saw a controversial period known as "Inoki-ism," where Antonio Inoki, still involved behind the scenes, pushed for a blend of professional wrestling and mixed martial arts (MMA). This era was marked by NJPW wrestlers competing in legitimate MMA fights and the introduction of MMA-style matches within NJPW events. Although this crossover was intended to emphasize "Strong Style," it often led to mismatches, injuries, and a decline in fan interest, as many traditional wrestling fans disliked the shift toward realism.

Despite the controversies, NJPW managed to produce top stars like Yuji Nagata, Hiroshi Tanahashi, and Shinsuke Nakamura, who became key figures in leading the promotion out of this tumultuous period.

The Tanahashi Era and Revival (2007-2011)
By the mid-2000s, NJPW faced declining popularity and financial struggles. The turning point came under the leadership of Hiroshi Tanahashi, who emerged as the "Ace" of the promotion. Tanahashi, known for his charisma, technical skills, and dedication to classic wrestling, revitalized the company by reconnecting with fans and producing memorable matches. His rivalry with wrestlers like Shinsuke Nakamura, Kazuchika Okada, and others helped NJPW regain its position as Japan's premier wrestling promotion.

In 2007, NJPW was acquired by the Bushiroad company, which invested significantly in the promotion, improving production values, marketing, and expanding NJPW’s reach internationally.

Global Expansion and the Rise of Bullet Club (2012-2018)
NJPW’s popularity surged in the 2010s, largely due to the emergence of Kazuchika Okada, who became the face of the company alongside Hiroshi Tanahashi. Okada’s matches, particularly his legendary feud with Tanahashi, were pivotal in building NJPW’s modern success. The promotion gained further global attention with the formation of Bullet Club in 2013, led by Prince Devitt (later known as Finn Bálor). The stable, composed of foreign wrestlers, brought a rebellious, edgy dynamic to NJPW, which resonated with international audiences.

Bullet Club became a major attraction, especially with the involvement of stars like AJ Styles, Kenny Omega, and The Young Bucks, helping NJPW gain a foothold in Western markets. NJPW expanded its global reach by launching the NJPW World streaming service in 2014, which allowed fans worldwide to watch their events, and by holding shows outside Japan, such as in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.

Modern Era and Further Globalization (2019-Present)
By 2019, NJPW had established itself as a major global wrestling promotion, rivalling companies like WWE. The promotion continued to thrive with stars like Kazuchika Okada, Tetsuya Naito, Kota Ibushi, and Jay White, and it began collaborating with other wrestling promotions, including AEW (All Elite Wrestling), ROH (Ring of Honor), and CMLL (Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre).

The G1 Climax tournament became one of the most anticipated events in pro wrestling, with fans worldwide following it each year. NJPW furthered its international ambitions by launching NJPW Strong in 2020, a U.S.-based show aimed at expanding the promotion's presence in North America and showcasing both Japanese and American talents.

Legacy and Impact
NJPW's emphasis on "Strong Style," technical excellence, and long-term storytelling has made it a respected name in the wrestling world. The promotion's focus on building stars through epic rivalries and matches has produced some of the most iconic moments and matches in wrestling history. The success of stables like Bullet Club and LIJ (Los Ingobernables de Japón) and the rise of international stars have contributed to its global reputation.

Today, NJPW stands as a bridge between traditional Japanese wrestling and a more global, inclusive vision, maintaining its legacy while adapting to the evolving landscape of professional wrestling.
