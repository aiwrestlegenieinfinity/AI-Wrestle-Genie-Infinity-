Brief History of International Wrestling (1983–1987)

International Wrestling was a professional wrestling promotion based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It served as a spiritual successor to the once-thriving Montreal wrestling territory, which had declined after the collapse of Grand Prix Wrestling in the late 1970s. The promotion achieved prominence between 1983 and 1987 under the leadership of the Rougeau family and other key figures in the region. It provided a platform for both emerging local talents and established international stars.

During this period, International Wrestling became known for its mix of traditional wrestling styles and modern storytelling, appealing to Quebec's Francophone audience. The promotion regularly featured broadcasts on local television, which allowed it to develop a strong regional following. Stars like Dino Bravo, Rick Martel, and the Rougeau brothers (Jacques and Raymond) played significant roles in the promotion's success.

However, by the late 1980s, the rise of Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF) began encroaching on regional promotions, including International Wrestling. The promotion folded in 1987, marking the end of an era for independent wrestling in Quebec.

Lutte Internationale (1983–1987)

Known as the French branding of International Wrestling, Lutte Internationale catered to Montreal's Francophone audience with culturally resonant storytelling and a roster of talent that appealed to local tastes. The promotion's shows were televised in French, contributing to its wide popularity in Quebec. It became a breeding ground for future wrestling stars and maintained a competitive presence despite the WWF's growing dominance.
