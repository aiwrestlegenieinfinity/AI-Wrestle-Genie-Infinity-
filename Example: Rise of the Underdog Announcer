    Week-by-Week Breakdown

       Week 1: Inciting Incident   ( Monday Nitro )
Tony Schiavone is interviewing Ric Flair and Arn Anderson backstage. The nWo crashes the segment, with Scott Hall mockingly telling Schiavone, “You’re just as washed up as these two fossils.” Hogan laughs and spray-paints “nWo” on Tony’s suit jacket. Tony’s expression shows discomfort, but he doesn’t retaliate, maintaining his professionalism.

The aftermath is shown in a backstage promo, where Schiavone, with visible frustration, says, “This ends now. If WCW needs defenders, count me in.”
