Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) was founded in 1989 by Atsushi Onita, a former All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) star. FMW revolutionized Japanese wrestling by focusing on hardcore, deathmatch-style wrestling, catering to fans who craved a more violent and intense product. Unlike traditional Japanese wrestling promotions, FMW emphasized extreme stipulations, featuring barbed wire, explosives, and fire in many of its matches.

Early Years and Onita's Influence (1989–1995)
FMW initially gained popularity through Atsushi Onita’s charisma and willingness to take punishment in dangerous matches. Onita’s rivalries, particularly with Tarzan Goto, Mr. Pogo, and The Sheik, helped establish FMW as a major attraction. The matches often featured high-stakes elements like exploding barbed wire and electrified cages, which attracted a dedicated fanbase. Onita’s storytelling approach combined with his personal investment in the promotion turned FMW into one of the hottest wrestling brands in Japan by the mid-1990s.

Women’s Division and Foreign Talent
FMW also incorporated a prominent women’s division, with stars like Megumi Kudo, Combat Toyoda, and Shark Tsuchiya, known for their brutal matches that mirrored the men’s hardcore style. Additionally, FMW featured foreign wrestlers such as Terry Funk and Mike Awesome, adding international appeal and showcasing unique wrestling styles.

Financial Difficulties and Management Shifts (1995–1997)
In 1995, Onita retired (though he would later return) and sold FMW to Shoichi Arai. Under Arai, the promotion faced financial difficulties, and its identity shifted from extreme deathmatches to a more wrestling-based product, attempting to gain mainstream appeal. Despite attempts to innovate with high-profile matches and talent like Hayabusa, the financial strain increased, and FMW struggled to regain its original momentum.

Hayabusa Era and Creative Struggles (1997–2001)
Hayabusa (Eiji Ezaki) became the face of FMW, known for his high-flying style and charismatic presence. His unique moveset and persona helped FMW maintain some of its fanbase, though the promotion continued to experiment with different wrestling styles. Tragically, in 2001, Hayabusa suffered a career-ending injury in the ring, leading to further financial and emotional blows to the promotion.

Bankruptcy and Legacy (2002–Present)
FMW declared bankruptcy in 2002, burdened by debt and unable to overcome the financial and creative issues it faced. Shoichi Arai committed suicide shortly afterward, marking a tragic end to the original FMW era. Despite its closure, FMW’s legacy continued, inspiring countless hardcore promotions worldwide and leaving a lasting impact on Japanese pro wrestling. Several revival attempts have been made under various owners, including promotions like FMW-E (FMW Explosion) in recent years, which have attempted to carry on the spirit of Onita’s deathmatch legacy.
