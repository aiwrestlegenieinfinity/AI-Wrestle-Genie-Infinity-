      Philosophical Debate:  

       Promo 1 – Lou Thesz:  
 "Ladies and gentlemen, what we do in that ring is a craft honed by sweat, blood, and discipline. Wrestling isn’t about bright lights or shallow theatrics—it’s about respect. Respect for the audience, who deserve competition, not cartoons. Respect for the men who trained tirelessly to grapple, to suplex, to pin, and to prevail. You call it 'entertainment'? I call it a mockery of everything men like Frank Gotch and Ed Lewis built. Wrestling must be grounded in reality, or we lose the very essence of what makes it special: truth." 

       Promo 2 – Vince McMahon:  
 "Ah, Lou, you see, the world has evolved. People don’t just want competition—they crave spectacle. They want heroes, villains, drama that transcends the ring. Tell me, does the average fan in 1989 even know a Greco-Roman hold? They come for Hulk Hogan ripping his shirt, for the pageantry of WrestleMania, and the magic of storytelling. Wrestling is an escape, Lou—a larger-than-life theater where the impossible becomes reality. Sport? Sure. But without the entertainment, there’s no audience."
