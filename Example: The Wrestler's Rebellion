      The Wrestler's Rebellion: A Historically Accurate Wrestling Storyline  

       Setting: WWF, 1998  
The late 1990s were a golden era for professional wrestling, with the WWF (now WWE) at the height of its Attitude Era. The product was edgy, unpredictable, and driven by a mix of reality and kayfabe. Vince McMahon, the on-screen chairman, had solidified himself as one of the greatest heel authority figures, primarily feuding with Stone Cold Steve Austin. However, the mid-card scene also saw turmoil, with stars frustrated by their placement in the hierarchy. This storyline focuses on one of those underutilized talents, Owen Hart, leading a rebellion against the tyranny of Vince McMahon and The Corporation.
