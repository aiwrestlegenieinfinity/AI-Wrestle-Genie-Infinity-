    Wrestling’s Forgotten Championships: The Western States Heritage Championship

---

  Inception & Significance  

The   Western States Heritage Championship   debuted in   1987  , under the banner of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) via Jim Crockett Promotions. Positioned as a midcard title, its creation aimed to spotlight regional wrestlers and serve as a stepping stone for emerging talents breaking into the national scene. The Western States title drew its name and spirit from the vast, rugged expanse of the American West, evoking themes of perseverance, grit, and opportunity.

At the time, wrestling was undergoing seismic shifts. The decline of regional territories in favor of national promotions like the WWF saw many smaller promotions struggling to maintain distinct identities. The Western States belt represented a throwback to territorial wrestling’s ethos, emphasizing athletic competition and regional pride.

  Barry Windham  , the inaugural champion, personified these ideals. Known for his technical prowess and cowboy charisma, Windham carried the title with dignity, defeating Black Bart in the tournament finals. His reign showcased the belt’s potential as a platform for high-caliber wrestling and storytelling. Windham’s success was symbolic of his Western roots and set a standard for future champions.

  Downfall & Obscurity  

Despite its promise, the Western States Heritage Championship struggled to gain traction amid Jim Crockett Promotions’ ambitious national expansion. The championship’s niche appeal was overshadowed by marquee titles like the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the United States Heavyweight Championship. The increased emphasis on star-driven narratives left the midcard title adrift, often relegated to secondary programming.

The title’s downfall was hastened by industry shifts—most notably, the 1988 sale of Jim Crockett Promotions to Ted Turner, forming World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The new promotion sought to streamline its championships to align with its broader television audience, leaving little room for the regional heritage that the Western States title embodied.

As the title faded from relevance, so did its emotional resonance. Wrestlers who had fought to elevate the belt, like Windham and Larry Zbyszko, expressed frustration in interviews, lamenting its potential as a proving ground for hungry competitors. By 1989, the Western States Heritage Championship quietly disappeared, its legacy overshadowed by the evolving wrestling landscape.

  Revival  

Fast forward to   2023  , where indie sensation   Caleb Cross  , a self-proclaimed "modern cowboy," stumbled upon the belt in an estate sale. Cross, a passionate student of wrestling history, saw the title as a symbol of wrestling’s forgotten roots and vowed to restore its prestige. Cross declared his mission during a viral social media promo:  "This belt isn’t dead. It’s waiting for someone with the guts to make it matter again." 

Cross’s quest was met with skepticism. Fans questioned the relevance of a long-defunct title, and promoters doubted its drawing power. However, Cross’s charisma and genuine respect for the belt’s history began to sway public opinion. He found an unlikely ally in   Terry Funk  , a hardcore icon and former Western States competitor, who offered mentorship and historical insight.

The road to revival was fraught with challenges. Cross faced resistance from established stars dismissing the belt’s importance, like indie heavyweight   "Big Time" Brody Kane  , who mocked Cross in promos as a "wannabe cowboy." Funk countered Kane’s rhetoric with fiery promos, defending the title’s lineage and Cross’s mission.

  Matches & Rivalries  

To prove the Western States title’s worth, Cross launched a   revival tournament   inspired by its original spirit. Held in Amarillo, Texas—a nod to Terry Funk’s legacy—the event attracted a mix of rising stars and veteran journeymen. Matches featured stipulations reminiscent of the territory days, including bullrope matches and Texas deathmatches.

Cross’s semifinals clash against rival Brody Kane was a brutal affair, ending with Cross narrowly escaping Kane’s devastating powerbomb to secure victory. The tournament culminated in a classic finals bout between Cross and veteran journeyman   Jason "The Iron Wrangler" Steele  , whose own Western-themed gimmick echoed the belt’s heritage. Cross emerged victorious after executing his signature  Cattleman’s Cutter , solidifying his status as the belt’s new torchbearer.
