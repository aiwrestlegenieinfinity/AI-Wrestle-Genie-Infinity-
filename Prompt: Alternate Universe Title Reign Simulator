#### **Algorithm Core Structure**  
1. **Historical Algorithm Setup for All Figures Involved**:  
   - **Wrestlers**: Define personas, signature moves, wrestling styles, and tendencies.  
   - **Managers**: Specify influence on match dynamics, crowd psychology, and interference patterns.  
   - **Referees**: Incorporate officiating style, alignment tendencies, and historical quirks.  
   - **Bookers**: Ensure alignment with overall creative vision, storytelling preferences, and era-specific booking tendencies.  
   - **Agents**: Focus on match layout expertise, storytelling beats, improvisational allowances, and finish execution.  
   - **Promotion Dynamics**: Include era-specific match structures, crowd behavior, and cultural references.  

2. **Randomized Match Details**:  
   - Opponent, referee, venue, match stipulations, card placement, storyline context, championship stakes, managers/valets, entrance themes, ring announcer, audience demographics, weather conditions (if applicable), special guest appearances, technical presentation, cultural references, and fan interactions are dynamically randomized for authenticity.  

3. **Pre-Match Creative Elements**:  
   - **Agent Instructions to Talent**:  
     - Define match pacing, storytelling beats, and signature spots to include.  
     - Discuss improvisational flexibility for crowd reactions or unexpected events.  
     - Ensure the match aligns with broader storylines and promotion goals.  
   - **Pre-Match Build-Up**:  
     - Create promotional materials such as video packages or highlight reels summarizing the feud.  
     - Add backstage interviews or in-ring promos to establish motivations.  
     - Include live promos at the entrance ramp or ringside to build tension and excitement.  

4. **Match Context Setup**:  
   - Specify the historical dynamics of the wrestlers and promotion.  
   - Define card placement and storyline integration.  
   - Ensure match type, venue, and external factors align with the era.  

5. **Match Execution**:  
   - **Ring Psychology**: Wrestlers should behave naturally according to their defined roles, using styles and strategies organically.  
     - **[Added Section: Randomized Negative In-Ring Work Elements]**  
       - **Randomized Possibilities**:
         - Introduce probabilistic checks for the following negative elements to enhance realism:  
           - **Sandbagging Moves**: Resistance during moves, especially in rivalries or high-pressure matches.  
           - **Botched Spots**: Higher probability during complex sequences or under fatigue.  
           - **Potatoes**: Occasional stiff strikes due to mistimed actions or heated rivalries.  
           - **No-Selling or Over-Selling**: Randomly aligned to character tendencies and crowd manipulation.  
           - **Blown Timing or Dead Space**: Missteps in synchronization or pacing, with increased risk in multi-person matches.  
           - **Crowd Disconnection**: Flat audience reactions due to poor improvisation or storytelling missteps.  
       - **Dynamic Adjustments**:
         - Wrestler-specific traits (experience, alignment) determine the likelihood and impact of these elements.  
         - Faces may use over-selling to build sympathy; heels may deliberately no-sell for heat.  
       - **Improvisation and Recovery**:
         - Assign probabilities for seamless recovery based on wrestler improvisation skills. Poor improvisers amplify the impact of errors.  
   - **Crowd Psychology**: Crowd reactions should dynamically influence in-ring behavior.  
   - **Match Structure**: Divide into logical phases (opening spots, heat segments, hope spots, comebacks, and finish).  
   - **Improvisation**: Allow for botches, crowd chants, unscripted interactions, and era-appropriate unpredictability.  
   - **Match Environment**: Reflect the setting, referee involvement, crowd size, and cultural atmosphere.  

6. **Post-Match Perspectives**:  
   - **Booker’s and Agent’s Perspectives**: Assess storytelling, execution, and alignment with creative goals.  
   - **Wrestlers’ Perspectives**: Include insights into their performance and in-match psychology.  
   - **Locker Room Sentiment and Humor**: Add realistic backstage reactions and humor.  
     - **New Instruction: Generate insights from a historically accurate member of the promotion’s roster for the specified year and promotion. Ensure their observations reflect their documented persona, alignment, and backstage demeanor.**  
     - **Steps**:  
       1. Select a verified roster member active in the specified year and promotion.  
       2. Craft their commentary to reflect era-appropriate language and personality.  
       3. Highlight their perspective on match psychology, storytelling, or character performances.  
   - **Fan Perspectives**: Highlight responses from casual, hardcore, and cultural fan segments.  
   - **Other Contexts**: Commentary team analysis, production crew evaluations, and sponsor perspectives when applicable.  

7. **Dirtsheet Match Review with Star Rating**:  
   - Provide an insider-style critique (e.g., "Dave Meltzer-type") evaluating match quality, pacing, storytelling, crowd reactions, and execution.  
   - Assign a star rating based on industry norms.
