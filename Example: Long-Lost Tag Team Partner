    Storyline: The Long-Lost Tag Team Partner – AWA 1987

       Backstory of Their Partnership and Split  
In 1985, the AWA featured a promising young tag team called   The Heartbreak Express  , composed of Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty. Trained by veterans in the Texas territories, they were brought together by a shared flamboyant charisma and unparalleled athleticism. Known for their high-energy offense and synchronized tandem maneuvers like the double superkick, they captured the   AWA World Tag Team Championship   in 1986, defeating the rugged duo of   The Long Riders (Bill and Scott Irwin)  .

Their partnership unraveled when Shawn Michaels, influenced by legendary manager   Sherri Martel  , sought a solo career, citing Jannetty’s lack of ambition as a hindrance. Tensions boiled over in a match against   The Fabulous Freebirds   when Michaels walked out, leaving Jannetty to suffer a humiliating pinfall. This betrayal split the team, and both wrestlers pursued individual paths in the AWA, with Michaels embracing a cocky heel persona while Jannetty remained a crowd-favorite babyface.

       Catalyst for Reunion  
Fast forward to 1987. The AWA is struggling to combat the rise of WWF and WCW, prompting promoter Verne Gagne to organize a nostalgic   "Tag Team Legends Invitational"   to reignite fan interest. Marty Jannetty, still adored by fans but lacking a strong storyline, is booked to face a dominant new heel duo,   The Sheik's Army (Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissie’s proteges)  , in the first round. Outnumbered and overpowered, Jannetty is attacked post-match, his future in the tournament in jeopardy.

To everyone’s shock, Shawn Michaels, now sporting a more refined and arrogant persona, storms the ring. Wielding a chair, he fends off The Sheik’s Army, saving his former partner. The crowd explodes in chants of   “Heartbreak Express!”  , and Michaels, with a smirk, offers his hand to Jannetty. While initially hesitant, Jannetty shakes his hand, setting up an emotional reunion.

       Integration with Current Storylines  
This reunion shakes the locker room. AWA stalwarts like   Greg Gagne   and   Larry Zbyszko   express skepticism, questioning Michaels’ motives. Manager Sherri Martel, now aligned with Sheik Adnan, mocks the rekindled alliance, calling it a “desperate play for nostalgia.” The Sheik’s Army vows revenge, promising to destroy The Heartbreak Express once and for all.

Meanwhile, Michaels cuts a promo addressing his return. “People change, and I’m here to prove I’m not the same guy who walked out two years ago. Marty and I have unfinished business, and together, we’re unstoppable.”

       Key Matches Testing Chemistry  
The Heartbreak Express faces The Sheik’s Army in the semifinals of the tournament. Early in the match, their chemistry is rusty—mistimed tags and miscommunication lead to several near losses. Fans hold their breath as Jannetty accidentally hits Michaels with a crossbody. But as the match progresses, their old spark returns. They unleash a series of tandem moves, capped off with their iconic double superkick, securing the win.

In the finals, they face   The Midnight Rockers (Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose)   in a 30-minute classic. Despite lingering tension, Michaels and Jannetty rediscover their rhythm, displaying an emotional and physical synergy that overwhelms their opponents. They win the match and are crowned tournament champions.

       Individual and Collective Goals  
Post-tournament, Michaels reveals his ambition to reclaim the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, while Jannetty emphasizes the importance of restoring their legacy as a team. This divergence creates subtle friction. During a title match against   Nick Bockwinkel  , Jannetty inadvertently costs Michaels the win by distracting the referee, rekindling doubts about their partnership.

Michaels, in a rare face promo, assures fans, “We’re brothers. Brothers fight, but at the end of the day, we stand together.”

       Climactic Showdown and Resolution  
The rivalry with The Sheik’s Army escalates to a climactic steel cage match at   SuperClash III  . The stipulation: if Michaels and Jannetty lose, they must disband for good. The match is a brutal affair, with blood, drama, and heroic comebacks. In the end, Michaels executes a top-rope elbow drop while Jannetty hits a picture-perfect diving crossbody, securing their victory and cementing their place as AWA legends.

       Historical Context and Authenticity  
This storyline taps into the real-life AWA environment of 1987, emphasizing the promotion's reliance on nostalgic storylines to compete with larger promotions.

Fans’ chants of   “Rockers Reunite!”   echo the emotional investment in their comeback, while backstage newsletters speculate on Michaels’ eventual departure for the WWF.

This reunion not only revitalizes the AWA’s tag division but also highlights the enduring appeal of second chances and brotherhood in professional wrestling.
