All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) was one of the most influential women's wrestling promotions in Japan, founded in 1968 by Takashi Matsunaga and his brothers. The promotion gained prominence throughout the 1970s and 1980s, establishing a unique blend of athleticism and entertainment, which helped shape the modern style of women’s wrestling (joshi puroresu). AJW played a crucial role in popularizing the sport, not just in Japan but globally, especially during its peak years in the 1980s and 1990s.

Key Eras:

1. 1970s: Early Success and the Beauty Pair
- AJW gained national attention with the emergence of the "Beauty Pair" (Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda), who brought in a new generation of fans, combining athletic wrestling with idol-like popularity. Their success paved the way for the rise of women's wrestling in Japan.

2. 1980s: The Crush Gals and Golden Era
- The 1980s marked the peak of AJW, driven by the popularity of the "Crush Gals" (Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka). Their feuds, energetic style, and mainstream appeal brought AJW to new heights, making them pop culture icons. Other major stars included Dump Matsumoto, Jaguar Yokota, and Devil Masami.

3. 1990s: The Peak and Decline
- The early 1990s continued the legacy of stellar in-ring talent with stars like Manami Toyota, Aja Kong, Akira Hokuto, and Bull Nakano. AJW became known for its hard-hitting, high-paced matches that were regarded as some of the best in the world. However, financial difficulties and declining interest in the late 1990s led to the promotion’s struggles.

4. 2000s: Closure
- Despite efforts to regain popularity, AJW continued to lose its fanbase and eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2005, leading to its closure. The decline was a mix of economic challenges, increased competition, and a saturated market.

Legacy:
AJW’s influence can still be seen in today’s women’s wrestling, both in Japan and worldwide. Its emphasis on athleticism, storytelling, and the pioneering of long, complex matches set a standard that has been emulated and built upon in promotions around the globe.
