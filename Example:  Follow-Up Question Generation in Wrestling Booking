    Simulated Booking Session: Jim Cornette, Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994)  

     Scenario:  
The Rock 'n' Roll Express defeated The Heavenly Bodies clean in a high-profile tag team match. Cornette is strategizing the fallout and the next steps for both teams, using the follow-up prompts to guide his planning.

      1. Layered Narrative Arcs and Continuity    
  Cornette  :  
"Alright, we’ve got a hot program brewing. Ricky and Robert got their win, but we can’t let the heat die down. The Heavenly Bodies are the perfect foil—they’re cocky, athletic, and downright dirty. Next week, we have to plant seeds for a rematch, but we can’t rush it. Let’s tease some tension in the locker room. Maybe a vignette where Del Ray accuses Prichard of not pulling his weight. Keep the fans guessing whether they’re breaking up or doubling down."

      2. Multisensory Production Synergy    
  Cornette  :  
"For next week, we spotlight The Heavenly Bodies’ arrogance. Jimmy Del Ray’s got that smug strut, and Tom Prichard’s got the mean streak. Let’s open the show with a slow-motion highlight reel of their best moves—throw in some dramatic lighting and orchestral music to make them look untouchable.  

But for The Rock 'n' Roll Express? Keep it gritty. Have them cut a backstage promo in their street clothes. No music, just passion. They’re mad as hell about the Bodies’ antics and ready to fight."

      3. Advanced Wrestler Psychology    
  Cornette  :  
"We’ve got to play to Morton’s strengths—he’s the master of sympathy. Next week, we book a singles match: Ricky Morton vs. Tom Prichard. Early in the match, Prichard works Ricky’s leg, referencing the injury from two years ago. Morton sells like he’s fighting for his life, and when he finally makes his comeback, the crowd will blow the roof off.  

But here’s the twist—Del Ray interferes just as Ricky’s about to win. They take out his leg post-match, setting up a tag rematch with higher stakes."

      4. Referee and Manager Roles    
  Cornette  :  
"Next week, we lean into the interference. Let me come to ringside in the middle of Morton’s match, distracting the ref while Del Ray jumps in for the cheap shot. It’s classic heel manager stuff, but it always works.  

For the rematch, though, we up the ante—a no-disqualification stipulation to keep me involved but still give The Rock 'n' Roll Express a fair shot."

---

      5. Social Media and Fan Interaction (Pre-Digital Era)    
  Cornette  :  
"Let’s hit the hotline promos hard. Ricky Morton’s gotta call me out—‘Cornette, you better stay out of this, or I’m taking you out myself!’ I’ll respond with one of my classic rants, accusing the fans of bias and saying they’re the real cheaters for supporting a team that ‘can’t win without help from the refs.’  

On TV, we tease an announcement: ‘What will be the stipulation for the rematch? Call the Smoky Mountain hotline to find out!’ That’ll get the fans invested before the next show."

---

      6. Gimmick Match and Venue Utilization    
  Cornette  :  
"The rematch has to be in Knoxville. That’s Rock 'n' Roll Express country, and the stakes will feel higher. We go with a cage match to keep me out and ensure there’s no escape for The Heavenly Bodies.  

To make it unique, let’s call it the ‘Southern Justice Cage Match.’ No pinfalls—only submission or knockout. It’s gritty, it’s brutal, and it fits the territory’s vibe perfectly."

---

      7. Audience Engagement Techniques    
  Cornette  :  
"When we’re in Knoxville, Ricky needs to lean into the hometown hero angle. Let him come out wearing a Tennessee Volunteers jacket, waving the state flag. That’ll get the crowd behind him before the bell even rings.  

If we feel the crowd cooling during the match, we improvise. Morton’s great at reading the audience—he can pull them back in with a fiery comeback."

---

      8. Post-Match Fallout and Long-Term Hooks    
  Cornette  :  
"After the cage match, we’ve got two directions. If The Rock 'n' Roll Express wins, we set up a grudge six-man tag with them and Bobby Fulton against The Heavenly Bodies and myself. That gives us a fresh twist.  

If The Heavenly Bodies cheat their way to victory, we tease the Express bringing in an outsider to even the odds—maybe a legend like Terry Funk or Ricky Steamboat. Either way, we keep the story going strong."

---

    Final Booking Plan:  
-   Week 1  : Ricky Morton vs. Tom Prichard with Del Ray interference leading to a post-match beatdown.  
-   Week 2  : Announcement of a “Southern Justice Cage Match” in Knoxville.  
-   Week 3  : The Rock 'n' Roll Express vs. The Heavenly Bodies in the blow-off match, with potential for a six-man tag or outsider involvement afterward.  

  Cornette  :  
"Boys, this is textbook Smoky Mountain Wrestling—simple, emotional, and built on what the fans care about. Let’s get it done."
