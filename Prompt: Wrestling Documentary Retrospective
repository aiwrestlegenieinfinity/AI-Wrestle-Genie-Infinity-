Prompt: Create real-life historically accurate algorithms for all wrestling figures and elements involved.

Integrate   verified wrestling data   and era-appropriate cultural context to ensure authenticity. Incorporate the elements below to present a richly detailed account that honors both kayfabe storytelling and real-life backstage insights:

1.   Career Narrative    
   -   Rise, Peak, and Decline  : Pinpoint major turning points, from the wrestler’s breakout match or feud to their height of popularity and eventual downturn.  
   -   Psychological Focus  : Explore how the wrestler approached their matches, shaped their alignment (face, heel, or tweener), and adapted their persona over time.  
   -   Documentary Chapters  : If desired, divide the retrospective into multi-episode segments, each highlighting a milestone (e.g., “The Early Years,” “Championship Glory,” “The Final Bell”).

2.   Backstage Insights    
   -   Simulated Interviews  : Write short quotes or dialogues from key contemporaries—rival wrestlers, allies, promoters, or even ring announcers—shedding light on personal conflicts or supportive friendships.  
   -   Philosophical Tensions  : Show how booking committees, creative heads, or the wrestler themselves debated certain angles, finishes, or persona tweaks.

3.   Match Recollections    
   -   Archival Footage  : Recount pivotal matches with blow-by-blow narratives, as if the documentary includes real taped segments or fan-cam angles from the era.  
   -   Commentary Snippets  : Integrate era-specific commentary style—territory-era sincerity vs. Attitude Era edginess vs. modern sports-entertainment tone.  
   -   Dramatic Moments  : Emphasize high-stakes battles, comedic relief spots, or shocking swerves that defined the wrestler’s run.

4.   Territorial and Cultural Context    
   -   Promotion Dynamics  : Situate the wrestler’s journey within their promotion’s creative direction. If multiple promotions are involved, address cross-promotional feuds or territory-hopping.  
   -   Global Trends  : Tie in the state of wrestling worldwide—did Japanese strong style, Lucha libre, or hardcore influences color the wrestler’s approach?

5.   Influence and Legacy    
   -   Innovations  : Detail moves, match concepts, or storyline tropes the wrestler pioneered or popularized.  
   -   Mentoring and Proteges  : If the wrestler helped train younger talents, mention how that shaped the next generation.  
   -   Kayfabe Norms  : Discuss how the wrestler adhered to—or broke—kayfabe traditions, affecting fan perception and industry standards.

6.   Interactive Elements    
   -   Role-Playing Opportunities  : Encourage user choices in shaping the documentary’s editorial stance (e.g., highlight controversies or downplay them).  
   -   Moral Dilemmas  : (Optional) Pose scenarios—like the wrestler’s internal conflict about turning heel or refusing a questionable storyline.

7.   Audience and Era-Specific Engagement    
   -   Fan Reactions  : If it’s the ’80s, highlight letters to wrestling magazines; if it’s the 2010s, showcase online polls, social media spats, or YouTube highlight reels.  
   -   Media Portrayal  : Weave in quotes from wrestling journalists, TV segments, or shoot interviews for added authenticity.

8.   Final Conclusion    
   -   Career Denouement  : Chronicle the wrestler’s last appearances, final gimmick tweaks, or post-retirement cameos.  
   -   Modern Retrospective  : Show how fans, historians, or current wrestlers reference this star’s legacy—did they become a cult favorite, a mainstream icon, or a forgotten footnote?
