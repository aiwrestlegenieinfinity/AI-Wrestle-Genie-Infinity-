  Maurizio Plebani  , better known in the ring as   Horus L’Assoluto  , was the driving force behind the creation of ASCA. His vision was supported by a network of European wrestling veterans and regional promoters who sought to elevate the independent wrestling scene in Italy and surrounding regions.

The   Adriatic Special Combat Academy (ASCA)   was conceived as a   progressive and internationally connected independent wrestling promotion   with a mission to   fuse European strong style, technical wrestling, and high-flying action   into a single, dynamic product.  

ASCA's   core objectives   at its inception included:

-   Bridging European & International Wrestling Styles:   With influences from   British strong style, German catch wrestling, and Japanese puroresu  , ASCA set out to create an alternative to the mainstream entertainment-based wrestling found elsewhere.  
-   Becoming a Hub for International Talent:   Unlike many Italian promotions that primarily featured local wrestlers, ASCA positioned itself as a   destination for international independent stars  , featuring names like   Zack Sabre Jr., Tommy End (Malakai Black), Trent Seven, Marty Scurll, and Jimmy Havoc   in marquee matches.  
-   Highlighting Technical Excellence & Storytelling:   The promotion placed a strong emphasis on   in-ring work, submission-based wrestling, and long-term storytelling  , drawing inspiration from the likes of   Ring of Honor (ROH), PROGRESS Wrestling, and wXw  .  
-   Creating a Sustainable European Wrestling Ecosystem:   ASCA worked alongside promotions such as   ICW (Italian Championship Wrestling)   and   BWT (Best Wrestling Team)   to develop a structured wrestling scene in Italy, introducing   tournaments, title defenses, and collaborative supercards   that unified different promotions under one competitive umbrella.  

ASCA’s commitment to   work rate-driven matches, international partnerships, and a hybrid wrestling style   helped it establish itself as a   pioneer in modern Italian wrestling  . Its early success in attracting European and global talent   cemented its reputation as a proving ground for elite independent wrestlers   while remaining deeply rooted in   developing homegrown talent  .

     Historical Context (2011-2015): The Italian Wrestling Scene at ASCA’s Founding    
When   ASCA was founded in 2011  , Italy’s professional wrestling industry was still   struggling to establish itself on the global stage  . Unlike wrestling hotbeds such as   the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan  , Italy lacked a   deeply ingrained wrestling culture  , and mainstream television coverage of wrestling was largely dominated by   WWE programming  .  

  Key issues facing the Italian wrestling scene at the time:    
1.   Limited Mainstream Presence:    
   - Italian wrestling had   no major TV deal  , and most promotions operated on a   grassroots level  , relying on   live events, social media, and word-of-mouth  .  
   - The absence of a   sustained, well-funded national promotion   meant that most wrestlers   had to seek work abroad   to gain significant exposure.  

2.   Fragmented Independent Circuit:    
   - While promotions like   Italian Championship Wrestling (ICW)   and   Best Wrestling Team (BWT)   existed, they   operated in isolation  , rarely coordinating talent exchanges or joint supercards.  
   -   ASCA’s founding goal   was to   change this by bridging Italy’s independent scene with the broader European wrestling ecosystem  .  

3.   The Rise of European Wrestling (2010s):    
   -   British and German wrestling   were entering a   renaissance period  , with promotions like   PROGRESS Wrestling (UK), Revolution Pro (UK), and wXw (Germany)   showcasing some of the best independent talents in the world.  
   - The   rise of technical wrestling and hybrid strong-style   saw the emergence of talents such as   Zack Sabre Jr., Tommy End (Malakai Black), and Will Ospreay  , all of whom would eventually compete in ASCA.  
   - ASCA sought to   import this high-caliber wrestling to Italy  , giving fans access to   world-class technical and strong-style wrestling   while allowing local talents to share the ring with global stars.

---

     1. Financial Struggles: The Cost of Running an International Indie Promotion    

      1.1. Limited Infrastructure & Sponsorships    
- Unlike   wXw (Germany) or PROGRESS (UK)  , ASCA lacked a   major TV deal, wealthy investors, or long-term sponsorships  .  
-   Primary revenue sources:    
  -   Ticket sales (Live events were ASCA’s lifeline, making consistency difficult).    
  -   Merchandising (Limited distribution outside Italy).    
  -   Cross-promotional partnerships (Shared profits, but reduced control over branding).    

      1.2. Financial Toll of Booking International Talent    
- Bringing in   top-tier names like Zack Sabre Jr., Marty Scurll, and Tommy End   required   travel costs, accommodations, and match fees  .  
-   Problem:   Without   a steady stream of revenue  , ASCA   couldn’t always afford to retain these high-profile stars long-term  .  
-   Impact:    
  - Forced ASCA to   rely more on local and regional wrestlers post-2017  .  
  - Created   periods of roster instability   where star power fluctuated.

  -   Loss of ticket revenue   due to lockdowns.  
  -   Cancellations of cross-promotional events   with wXw and ICW.  
  -   Reduced roster depth   as wrestlers sought more stable promotions.  

      1.4. Financial Survival Strategy    
-   Pivoted to digital expansion   (social media, streaming efforts).  
-   Increased focus on hardcore wrestling  , which had a niche but loyal audience.  
-   More reliance on homegrown talent  , reducing travel expenses.  

---

     2. Roster Changes: ASCA’s Struggle to Maintain Consistency    

      2.1. Departure of Key International Stars    
-   2016-2019 saw ASCA lose several marquee names to bigger promotions:    
  -   Tommy End → WWE (NXT, later AEW as Malakai Black).    
  -   Trent Seven & Zack Sabre Jr. → Expanded UK & NJPW commitments.    
  -   Marty Scurll → ROH, distancing himself from ASCA bookings.    
-   Impact:    
  - Forced ASCA to   rebuild its main event scene   around   Horus L’Assoluto, Akira, and Arrows of Hungary  .  
  - Created   a perception of ASCA as a “stepping stone” promotion   rather than a long-term home.  

      2.2. Retirements & Injuries    
-   Key losses:    
  -   Kyo Kazama (2017)   – Stepped away from full-time wrestling, ending one of ASCA’s best technical rivalries.  
  -   Red Devil (2018)   – Reduced in-ring appearances, impacting ASCA’s lightweight division.  
-   Impact:    
  - These losses   removed core figures who had carried ASCA’s identity   since its early years.  

      2.3. The Rise of New Blood (2020-Present)    
-   To counter roster instability, ASCA built around newer stars:    
  -   Akira (Hardcore icon, post-2021 main eventer).    
  -   Icarus & Dover (Tag team dominance with Arrows of Hungary).    
-   Result:    
  - ASCA   shifted toward deathmatch wrestling   and   strong-style storytelling  , embracing a more niche identity.

     3. Backstage Issues: Politics, Scheduling, and Creative Disputes    

      3.1. Scheduling Conflicts with UK & German Promotions

-   Tension between traditional technical wrestling and hardcore elements:    
  - Some   wrestlers resisted ASCA’s shift toward deathmatch wrestling (post-2020)  .  
  - A few   technical specialists left, feeling the new direction hurt ASCA’s work-rate reputation  .  

      3.3. Budget Disputes & Payment Delays    
- While ASCA had   no major financial scandals  , some wrestlers reportedly   went unpaid or received late payments during ASCA’s leaner years  .  
-   Similar to issues seen in other European indies  , this created occasional   locker-room frustrations  .  

---

     4. Competition: Fighting for Survival Against Other Promotions    

      4.1. Competition with ICW (Italian Championship Wrestling)    
-   ICW was Italy’s largest and longest-running promotion   with:  
  -   Stronger brand recognition   in Italy.  
  -   A different philosophy   (more entertainment-based compared to ASCA’s work-rate focus).  
-   ASCA’s challenge:    
  -   Convince Italian fans that a more athletic, work-rate-driven product was superior.    
  -   Win over homegrown talent that might otherwise debut in ICW.    

      4.2. The Rise of PROGRESS, RevPro, and wXw (2015-2019)    
-   UK and German indies exploded in popularity  , causing:  
  -   Top ASCA wrestlers (like Trent Seven) to prioritize UK bookings.    
  -   Financial strain on ASCA  , which had to compete with higher-paying British promotions for talent.  
-   Example:    
  -   Marty Scurll’s last ASCA appearance (2016) came after signing a long-term ROH contract, limiting further ASCA dates.    

      4.3. COVID-19 and the Shift to Streaming-Based Promotions    
-   European indies that adapted to streaming (PROGRESS on WWE Network, wXw on wXwNOW) thrived.    
-   ASCA struggled to transition  , relying on live events as its primary income source.  
-   Impact:    
  - ASCA   fell behind competitors who successfully monetized digital content  .
