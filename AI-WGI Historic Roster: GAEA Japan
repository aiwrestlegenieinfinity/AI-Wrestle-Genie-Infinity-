GAEA Japan was a Japanese women's professional wrestling promotion founded by Chigusa Nagayo on April 15, 1995, and operated until April 10, 2005. Here is a brief history:

1995 Formation and Early Years: GAEA Japan was established by Chigusa Nagayo, one of the most iconic figures in women's wrestling, after her departure from All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (AJW). The promotion was formed to create new stars and offer a different style of wrestling compared to existing companies. Its first event took place on April 15, 1995, and attracted significant attention due to Nagayo's name and legacy.

Rise in Popularity (Mid 1990s): In its early years, GAEA Japan focused on developing new talents while featuring established names like Nagayo herself. Wrestlers such as Meiko Satomura, Toshie Uematsu, and Sonoko Kato became the faces of the promotion. The company quickly gained a reputation for its intense matches, unique mix of experienced veterans and young talent, and for pushing its younger wrestlers into prominent positions.

Inter promotional Rivalries: GAEA became known for its inter promotional feuds, notably with AJW and later with JWP. These rivalries helped boost its profile and led to several high stakes matches that garnered fan interest. The feud with AJW, especially, played on the history of Chigusa Nagayo as a member of the Crush Gals, drawing older fans back to watch her once again.

2000 2005: Peak and Decline: Throughout the early 2000s, GAEA Japan maintained a strong roster and became one of the most prominent women's wrestling promotions in Japan. However, the company struggled financially as the wrestling scene overall was declining in popularity. Despite efforts to innovate, including the founding of the GAEA Academy to train new wrestlers, the promotion faced increasing challenges.

Closure in 2005: After a decade of operation, GAEA Japan held its final event on April 10, 2005, marking the end of an era. The closure was attributed to financial difficulties and the changing landscape of women's wrestling in Japan. Chigusa Nagayo would later go on to establish Marvelous That's Women Pro Wrestling (Marvelous) in 2015, continuing her legacy of training and promoting women's wrestling.

GAEA Japan's legacy is highlighted by its role in fostering the careers of several top stars in women’s wrestling, including Meiko Satomura, who went on to have a successful career internationally.
