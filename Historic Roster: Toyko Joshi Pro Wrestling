Tokyo Joshi Pro Wrestling (TJPW) was established in 2012 as a women's professional wrestling promotion under the umbrella of DDT Pro Wrestling. Initially, it was conceived as a smaller, more lighthearted and idol centric alternative to other Japanese women's wrestling organizations. TJPW focused on a mix of entertainment and athleticism, incorporating elements of humor, cosplay, and theatrical presentation, which distinguished it from more traditional promotions.

Early Years (2012 2015):
The promotion started with small shows, primarily held in Tokyo. TJPW built its roster around aspiring idols and performers rather than experienced wrestlers, creating a niche for itself within the Japanese wrestling scene. Early standouts included Miyu Yamashita and Shoko Nakajima, who would go on to become cornerstones of the promotion. During this period, TJPW was known for its more playful matches, with a strong focus on characters and gimmicks.

Growth and Expansion (2016 2018):
As the roster developed, TJPW began to focus more on wrestling quality, while still maintaining its unique entertainment elements. Wrestlers like Yuka Sakazaki, Maki Itoh, and Rika Tatsumi emerged, bringing more in ring credibility and helping to attract a dedicated fanbase. The creation of the Tokyo Princess of Princess Championship in 2016 marked TJPW's shift toward being seen as a legitimate wrestling promotion. Miyu Yamashita became the inaugural champion, solidifying her role as the face of the company.

International Collaboration and Recognition (2019 2021):
TJPW gained international attention through its relationship with DDT Pro Wrestling and later through partnerships with All Elite Wrestling (AEW). Wrestlers like Yuka Sakazaki and Shoko Nakajima appeared on AEW shows, introducing the promotion to Western audiences. The popularity of characters like Maki Itoh, whose social media presence helped her become a fan favorite overseas, further increased TJPW's global reach. During this period, TJPW continued to refine its in ring style, blending comedy with athleticism and building stronger narratives around its championships.

Establishing a Strong Roster (2022 Present):
In recent years, TJPW has continued to build its roster with a mix of homegrown talent and established names from other promotions. Wrestlers like Mizuki, Hyper Misao, and Nao Kakuta have become prominent figures, while international appearances have remained a crucial part of TJPW's strategy. The promotion has also emphasized running more significant events at larger venues, such as the annual "Wrestle Princess" shows, to highlight its top feuds and talent.

TJPW's blend of vibrant characters, compelling storytelling, and quality wrestling has allowed it to carve out a unique place in the Japanese wrestling landscape. Its commitment to both entertainment and in ring action continues to appeal to a broad audience, both domestically and internationally.
