Ice Ribbon: Brief and Comprehensive History

Formation and Early Years (2006 2009)
Ice Ribbon was founded in 2006 by Emi Sakura, initially operating as a smaller independent joshi promotion. It distinguished itself with a focus on training new talent, including young girls and beginners, which was unconventional compared to other promotions. Initially, shows were held in a dojo environment, but the company quickly gained attention for its intimate, fast paced matches and commitment to fostering new talent.

Expansion and Rise (2010 2014)
The promotion began gaining momentum by the early 2010s, expanding its events to larger venues and cultivating a dedicated fanbase.

The Ice Ribbon Championship was introduced, becoming a symbol of excellence within the promotion.

Leadership Change and Growth (2015 2019)

During this period, Ice Ribbon solidified its reputation for quality women’s wrestling.

Modern Era and Challenges (2020 Present)

Despite the challenges, the promotion remained resilient, continuing to feature prominent talents like Suzu Suzuki, Maya Yukihi, and others. However, Ice Ribbon faced further transitions, with some wrestlers departing to form or join other ventures. The promotion continues to operate, maintaining its focus on nurturing new talent and providing a platform for dynamic joshi wrestling.
