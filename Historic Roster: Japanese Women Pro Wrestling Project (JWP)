The Japanese Women Pro Wrestling Project (JWP) was a pioneering women's wrestling promotion in Japan, known for its role in reshaping the landscape of joshi puroresu. Here is a brief history:

Formation and Early Years (1986-1992)
JWP was founded in 1986 by Masatoshi Yamamoto, a businessman who aimed to create an alternative to the established All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW). Initially branded as JWP Joshi Puroresu , the promotion sought to provide more variety in women's wrestling, featuring a mix of athleticism, technical wrestling, and character-driven personas. Early stars included Devil Masami and Dynamite Kansai , who would help establish JWP's reputation for strong, hard-hitting matches. The promotion focused on technical in-ring work and introduced new styles to the joshi scene, differentiating itself from AJW.

Split and Rebranding (1992-1999)
In 1992, internal disputes led to a significant split, resulting in the formation of two separate entities : JWP's main brand evolved into JWP Project , and some wrestlers and staff formed a rival promotion called LLPW (Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling) . JWP Project continued under new management and began to gain more mainstream appeal. This period saw the rise of Dynamite Kansai , Mayumi Ozaki , and Cutie Suzuki , who were instrumental in bringing JWP to broader audiences. JWP became known for intense rivalries and inter-promotional matches, especially with organizations like AJW and FMW, which helped increase its visibility.

Growth and Expansion (2000s)
Throughout the 2000s, JWP focused on nurturing young talent and maintaining its reputation for hard-hitting, technical matches. It regularly collaborated with other promotions, which helped to keep the brand alive despite the changing dynamics of the industry. Wrestlers such as Azumi Hyuga , Command Bolshoi , and Kayoko Haruyama became prominent figures during this time. JWP also emphasized the training of new wrestlers, ensuring the continuity of its style and ethos.

Decline and Closure (2010-2017)
By the 2010s, the joshi scene had seen the emergence of many smaller promotions, which increased competition. Despite its long-standing history, JWP struggled to maintain the same level of influence. In 2017, the decision was made to close the promotion , and it was rebranded as PURE-J , effectively marking the end of JWP but continuing its legacy. PURE-J carries forward the spirit of JWP, emphasizing a mix of classic and contemporary joshi wrestling styles.

JWP's legacy remains significant for its contribution to the evolution of women's wrestling in Japan, known for its emphasis on technical skill, strong characters, and inter-promotional collaborations that pushed the boundaries of the joshi wrestling scene.
