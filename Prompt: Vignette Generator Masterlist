## ALGORITHM FOR RANDOM VIGNETTE CREATION

**Instructions**: Use the following steps to craft a **random** pro wrestling vignette. You can roll dice, use a random number generator, or simply pick whichever options you like at each step.

---

### **STEP 1: Select the Vignette Angle**

1. Roll or randomly pick **1 to 3** angles from the **Master List** above (e.g., “Feud/Rivalry Build-Up,” “Hair vs. Title,” “Veteran’s Last Stand,” etc.).  
2. If you choose multiple angles, **blend** them creatively (e.g., A comedic training vignette that also reveals a secret manager’s scheme).  
3. If they clash, either **pick again** or **invent a reason** they work together (e.g., an Apocalyptic Match Hype at an abandoned stadium overseen by an Authority Figure Showdown).

---

### **STEP 2: Identify Major Players**

1. **Protagonist**  
   - Examples: *Rookie Sensation, Veteran Legend, Rising Star, Manager’s Protégé, etc.*  
2. **Antagonist**  
   - Examples: *Champion’s Rival, Outlaw Bounty Hunter, Betrayer, Corporate Stooge, etc.*  
3. **Supporting Roles**  
   - Could include: *Manager, Mentor, Tag Partner, Long-Lost Sibling, Authority Figure,* etc.

---

### **STEP 3: Define the Motivation / Conflict**

1. **Why is this angle happening?**  
   - *A pursuit of gold*, *long-standing feud*, *manager’s cunning plan*, *dark personal rivalry*, *family legacy at stake*, etc.  
2. **Emotional Hook**  
   - *Respect, Redemption, Betrayal, Ambition, Legacy, Overcoming Demons,* etc.  
3. **Personal Backstory**  
   - Weave in any relevant elements (e.g., *Dark Past Revelation, Injury Comeback, Sibling Rivalry,* etc.).

---

### **STEP 4: Choose Setting and Tone**

1. **Location**  
   - *Backstage area, Training camp, Graveyard (Apocalyptic hype), Boardroom (Authority figure), Family ranch*, etc.  
2. **Atmosphere**  
   - *Comedic, Gritty, High-stakes, Surreal, Melancholy, Lighthearted, Over-the-top,* etc.

---

### **STEP 5: Story Beats (Three-Act Structure)**

1. **Act 1: Hook / Setup**  
   - Introduce the main angle and characters.  
   - Show what each side wants (e.g., *title, revenge, respect*).  

2. **Act 2: Escalation / Twist**  
   - Reveal new obstacles, betrayal, comedic accident, or big challenge.  
   - If you selected multiple angles, weave them here (e.g., a *Manager’s Scheme* interfering with a *Hair vs. Mask* showdown).  

3. **Act 3: Cliffhanger / Resolution**  
   - Provide partial resolution or set up a decisive match at the pay-per-view.  
   - Possibly resolve the conflict entirely (someone unmasked, storyline closure).  

---

### **STEP 6: Add Depth via Subplots**

- **Family or Mentor Ties**: references to a legendary father, or an old mentor returning.  
- **Personal Obstacles**: overcoming injury, personal demons, or cultural barriers.  
- **Fan Interaction**: a fan vote determines the match stipulation.  
- **Moral Conflict**: a hero pulled between two factions or mentors.  

---

### **STEP 7: Determine Outcome Implications**

1. **If resolved now**: show aftermath (new champion, unmasked wrestler, forced to leave town).  
2. **If leading to a match**: hype the final confrontation.  
3. **Next Feud Setup**: hint at the next big rival or scenario.

---

### **STEP 8: Optional Advanced Layering**

- **Authority Figure Showdown**: the GM or commissioner threatens suspension or changes rules mid-story.  
- **Cross-Promotion**: an invasion from another federation.  
- **Mentor vs. Protégé**: heartbreak as teacher and student clash.  
- **Undercover or Spy Angle**: someone’s identity is secretly revealed.  
- **Time-Limit Draw / Sudden Death**: inject final drama into a culminating match.

---

### **STEP 9: Final Output / Script Summary**

Pull it all together into a short, 1-2 paragraph pitch:

1. **Title/Label**: e.g., “THE UNMASKING AT DAWN,” “CORPORATE TAKEOVER SHOWDOWN”  
2. **Cast**: protagonist, antagonist, supporting roles.  
3. **Core Conflict**: the main angle from Step 1 and its emotional stakes.  
4. **Notable Moments**: comedic, shocking, or heartfelt highlights.  
5. **Conclusion or Cliffhanger**: does it end here or build to the next show?

---

## Usage Example

You might roll a random number and get **“53”** (Hero’s Farewell) as your main angle. You then pick a protagonist (a beloved veteran), an antagonist (a rising heel champion), define the conflict (the veteran’s last match is overshadowed by the heel’s arrogance), choose a location (the veteran’s hometown arena), and weave your three acts. Wrap it up with a tearful farewell or a stunning betrayal that sets up a final match at the next big event.

1. The **FULL list** of angles.  
2. A **detailed algorithm** for weaving any random angles into a cohesive pro wrestling vignette.
