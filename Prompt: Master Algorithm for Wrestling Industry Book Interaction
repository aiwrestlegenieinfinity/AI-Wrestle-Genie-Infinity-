Master Algorithm for Wrestling Industry Book Interaction 

       1. Input & Pre-Processing  

1.   Book Upload & Multi-Format Ingestion    
   - Accept full-text uploads (PDF, ePub, Word, scanned documents, or HTML).  
   - If the text is scanned, employ OCR to convert images to digital text.  
   - Validate file integrity and check for missing pages.

2.   Text Cleansing & Normalization    
   - Remove non-relevant content (footnotes, references, front/back matter) as needed.  
   - Perform normalization steps (case normalization, handling special characters, removing formatting artifacts) for consistent data.

       2. Text Summarization & Extraction  

3.   Advanced Summarization    
   - Use NLP-based summarizers to generate concise overviews of each chapter.  
   - Identify main themes (e.g., major feuds, promotions, management decisions) via topic modeling or clustering.

4.   Named Entity & Topic Extraction    
   - Use specialized Named Entity Recognition to extract:  
     - Dates, wrestling promotions, wrestler names, championship titles, etc.  
   - Gather direct quotes or key anecdotes for reference.  
   - Assign confidence scores to extracted data for quick validation.

       3. Character & Event Analysis  

5.   Character Profiles Creation    
   - Automatically compile all references to each major wrestler, manager, promoter, etc.  
   - Include detailed biographical info, career timelines, notable rivalries, and achievements.  
   - Cross-reference with external databases for accuracy (dates of title reigns, promotions worked for, etc.).

6.   Event & Feud Recaps    
   - Identify and summarize each key event, storyline, or major match.  
   - Where available, incorporate external metrics (TV ratings, PPV buy-rates, attendance figures) to contextualize impact.

       4. Contextualization & Fact-Checking  

7.   Timeline Creation with External Data    
   - Create a chronological timeline of events, incorporating verified data from wrestling archives.  
   - Highlight significant transitions in the industry (company buyouts, brand splits, etc.).

8.   Automated Fact-Checking & Cross-Referencing    
   - Compare dates, match results, and other details against known historical databases.  
   - Generate discrepancy reports for any conflicting or questionable information.  
   - Assign confidence scores or “verified” tags where data matches external sources.

10.   Statistical & Sentiment Analysis    
   - Optionally evaluate sentiment in backstage segments, fan reactions, or critical reception commentary.  
   - Correlate certain creative decisions with metrics like attendance, TV ratings, or merchandise sales.

11.   Contextual Media & Match Recommendations    
   - Recommend relevant footage (promos, shoot interviews, documentary segments) that enhance understanding.  
   - Provide direct references (e.g., recommended PPV events on known streaming services).

       6. Visualization & Presentation  

12.   Dynamic Dashboards & Visual Summaries    
   - Generate timelines, charts, or infographics for events, wrestler careers, or overall industry changes.  
   - Make these dashboards interactive, allowing filtering by year, promotion, or storyline.

13.   Interactive Content & Educational Tools    
   - Build quizzes or flashcards covering key wrestlers, events, and storylines for deeper learning.  
   - Provide a list of discussion prompts for group reading or wrestling fan communities.

       7. Creative Development  

14.   Wrestling Match Simulations    
   - Simulate matches using data-driven parameters (wrestler styles, historical match quality, era context).  
   - Offer a break-down of spots, crowd reactions, and star ratings for a realistic “insider” touch.

15.   AI-Assisted Character or Storyline Scripting    
   - Auto-generate promos, interviews, or new angles building on the book’s storyline elements.  
   - Integrate known catchphrases, signature moves, or signature narrative beats for authenticity.

       8. Educational Tools & Accessibility  

16.   Generating Educational Material    
   - Create worksheets, study guides, and tutorials that explore key concepts (e.g., booking strategies, brand management).  
   - Provide materials in accessible formats (text-to-speech, high-contrast visuals).

17.   User-Focused Queries & Accessibility    
   - Allow custom queries—e.g., “Focus on how tag teams shaped the mid-90s,” or “Compare WCW’s booking to WWF’s in 1998.”  
   - Provide graphs and content optimized for color-blind or visually impaired users.

---

       9. Editorial & Review  

18.   Review & Critique of Writing    
   - Assess clarity, historical rigor, and narrative flow of the book.  
   - Highlight areas where detail is lacking or context is needed for future editions.

19.   Contextualizing in Wrestling History    
   - Place the book’s events within the broader pro wrestling timeline.  
   - Outline how these events influenced the industry’s creative or financial trajectory.
